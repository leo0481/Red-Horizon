input: I woke up this morning feeling the whole room is spinning when i was sitting down. I went to the bathroom walking unsteadily, as i tried to focus i feel nauseous. I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor. 

input: my sone has left sided abd pain..lt pelvic and rt pelvic pain in the groin area.. can only stand for a short time and sitting impossible for the pain..ct showed inlarged lymph nodes..slight elevation in wt count. he has been 10 weeks and unable to get any relief other than rest and pain meds.. he is 32 6ft 3..approx 220 lb
output: Hi. If there is no relief, it is mandatory to get the biopsy of the node done ASAP to get a correct diagnosis. It may be a serious problem. As a rule - anything not getting OK within 1 to 3 weeks maximum should be removed and tested. Noe-a-days we can do this by laparoscopy too, one day care surgery...

input: My one year old son was bit in face by a pit bull two days ago he has had constant diarrhea since taking antibiotic and a bloody rash on his butt is he allergic to antibiotics or is it something serious? Also i noticed some bumps on his leg and one on his arm could he be allergic to fleas? Since we left that house where the dog was he hasn t gotten anymore bumps.... Last his eye where he was bit and had to have stitches is yellow now?
output: Hi.the diarrhea is due to Chat Doctor.  Frequent diarrhea causes perianal excoriation (red rash). Stop antibiotic and give Zinc orally 20 mg once a day for 14days. If pit bull was not vaccinated for rabies you need to vaccinate your child for rabies. Bite on face is dangerous. If you are happy with my suggestion kindly rate me. Regards - 

input: Hello, My husband is taking Oxycodone due to a broken leg/surgery. He has been taking this pain medication for one month. We are trying to conceive our second baby. Will this medication afect the fetus? Or the health of the baby? Or can it bring birth defects? Thank you.
output: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,

input: Id jaundice and chickengunea two years back. I have been having breathing issues since then. They come up and aggravate in weather change or a week before my periods. It makes it really difficult for me to breathe or perform any activity. Its accompanied by a mild yet persistent headache.
output: Thanks for your questioning my opinion possible causes can be-bronchial asthma- bronchitis you need to consult a Pulmonologist who can examine you and investigate regarding the respiratory issue in my patients I usually conduct a spirometry and a peak expiratory flow rate which can lead to a diagnosis and if it's an obstructive cause some inhaled Chat Doctor. 

input: lump under left nipple and stomach pain (male) Hi,I have recently noticed a few weeks ago a lump under my nipple, it hurts to touch and is about the size of a quarter. Also I have bern experiencing stomach pains that prevent me from eating. I immediatly feel full and have extreme pain. Please help
output: HI. You have two different problems. The lump under the nipple should be removed, biopsied. This will help you to get rid of the disease, and you get a diagnosis. Second problem looks a bit serious one: Pain that prevents you from eating-immediate fullness, and extreme pain. I would advise such a patient to undergo the upper GI endoscopy asap. This can be an ulcer with a problem at the pylorus. The exact diagnosis is the most important to start the right therapy. Do not waste time in starting the therapy.

input: I have a 5 month old baby who is very congested with a terrible cough. Its rattly/raspy and croupy sounding cough. She started choking on her coughs and the mucous that has come up. She also has a fever and runny nose. Should i take her to urgent care?
output: Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I would suggest that you see your doctor. Your baby maybe having bronchiolitis which is a lung infection common to your kids age. It is commonly caused by a virus. Albuterol via nebulization should be utilized in order to alleviate the wheezing and also help with the congestion. A decongestant can also be used for the colds. Also, it would also advise doing a chest X-ray in order to rule out other diseases (ex. pneumonia)sincerely, Mark RosarioGeneral pediatrics/Pediatric Pulmonology

input: I am F 38 in good shape work out (do triathlons) regular but have had back pain from different reasons throughout my life now I every so often wake up with severe lower back, hip pain for no reason. today the pain is almost taking my breathe away when i move. It is a dull pain when i am just lying down but the moment I make any sort of movement I have sharp and sometimes shooting pain down my legs.
output: Hi, From history it seems that you might be having degenerative changes in your lower back spines giving pinched nerve pressure. There might be having osteomalacia or osteoporosis as well. Go for x-ray lumbosacral region for osteoarthritis. Physiotherapy like back extension exercises will be much helpful. Take B1, B6, B!2 shots or medicine. Take calcium, vitamin A and D supplements. Ok and take care.

output: Cost for the treatment is around 8 to 10 lakhs in our center. This disease is very aggressive and success rate is about 40 percent of curing the disease.  In another 60 percent, we cannot guarantee any cure, as disease may not respond, may come back or transplant related deaths. You can contact our Chat Doctor, BANGALORE center FOR further details

input: sir, MY uncle has ILD-Interstitial Lung disease.from my research over google i found that the cause is important to be known. the cause wat i feel is due to breakage of acid bottle in bathroom which caused lot of smoke and that time he wasnot able to be normal for 15-20 minutes. then he was normal .may be that would have been the reason for this ILD. Please suggest wat we should do
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.

input: my husband was working on a project in the house and all of a sudden a bump about the size of a half dollar appeard on his left leg inside below the knee. He is 69 years old and had triple by pass surgery 7 years ago. It stung when it first happened. Doesn t hurt now. He is seated with his leg ellevated. Is this an emergency?
output: Hello. It could be a blood collection due to minor injury or a vein rupture which is also common at this age. It is not an emergency, but you should apply compression bandage and warm compresses if six hours have past. Furthermore, it should get relieved over the next few days but if it continues to increase or persist then you should see a Doctor who can examine the patient. Take care.  Chat Doctor. 

input: hi my nine year old son had a cough and flu symptons three months ago and the chesty sounding cough and green phlegm still remains. it did seem to get better but never totally went and has now picked up again...he has only ever had antibiotics once in his live which suggests he his generally fitand well and active...never short of breath or weezy...so why would this be....
output: Hi, If the symptoms persist that long this suggests the presence of an allergic element. To treat that kind of allergy you can give him an over the counter antihistamines once daily before going to bed. A cough suppressant as dextromethorphan and an expectorant as Murine will help reduce the cough. Make sure he Chat Doctor.  If the green phlegm persists he might require an antibiotic.

output: don't shave your vaginal area. Use hair removing ointment available in market. That will be safe avoid any injury to the vaginal and associated part.

I was looking to see if there was anything I could do to help the spots go away. I am a dental hygienist and I will be working the next two days.

output: Cellophane You for contacting Chat Doctor. Allergic reaction takes some time to settle. In the meanwhile you can cover it over the body by wearing appropriate long clothes which can cover most of the body to hide it. If itching occurs then you can take cetirizine once daily to prevent itching. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health.

input: hye, My aunt is having shortness of breath and she is on vent now. Her breast showed some kind of infection that apparently turned out to have black blisters. I could she those spreading. When we went for lungs x-ray doctor said she has accumulation of water in her lungs
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your aunts situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of bacterial infection especially staphylococcus is more in her case. She is having pleural effusion and infective skin lesions on breast. Staphylococcus can cause pleural effusion and blister formation on skin. So chances of staphylococcal infection is more in her case. Better to send pleural fluid culture and sensitivity for the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection. This will also tell about effective antibiotic therapy. With appropriate antibiotics and Care, this infection can be treated. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your aunt. Thanks.

input: i am 28 yrs old, i got married before 6 year, i was infected by pulmonary tuberculosis before 6 years, i took treatment for 6 months after that i statred gainig weigt, my periods was irredulat, i increased nearlt 20 kgs after that, now my weight is 75 kgs, i trying to conceive, i took tsh, other blood test too, but everything is normal, do i have the chances to conceive
output: Hi, thank you for asking Chat Doctor I understand your concerns No need to worry so much. The chances of conceiving still exist with irregular periods. I don't know if you have been trying to conceive but to no avail. If that is the case, then I think both of you have to be assessed. Infertility within a couple can be linked to a man, woman or both. If everything is fine with you except irregular periods, then I would advise that both of you should see a doctor for assessment and counseling. I hope that helps wish you well

I have not spotted at all, I have been nausaues and I smell everything, my breasts were tender for about a month, they stopped being last week, but they are still sensitive. I am so confused about whats going on with my body and if I am pregnant or not.
output: What was the first day of your period in April. That will make easier to explain why the test was negative in May 9th. As I see it the blood test taken on May 8th was negative, it means the urine test was phase positive.

My foot has been swollen since Friday. Today is Thursday. Kept ice on it for 24 hours. Bruising started after that, Now bruising is spreading. It is really dark on my toes. Pain is on outside of my foot, not on my ankle.

output: HiT hanks for choosing Chat Doctor for your query. I appreciate your concern towards H pylori infection which normally causes break in the lining of the stomach (peptic ulcer). H pylori is an exceptional bacterium which can survive in the acidic environment of the stomach producing tissue damage result in ulcer. Since this is a bacterial infection, hence antibiotics are used for 2 weeks to kill H pylori. Along with antibiotics Omeprazole is given for a period of 4-6 weeks to suppress the acid production and to increase the healing process of the ulcer. It is not a serious condition, usually triple treatment is sufficient to cure this condition. You must avoid taking Alcohol, hot and spicy foods, NSAID painkiller, smoking, caffeine, carbonated sweetened soft Chat Doctor. I hope all your doubts have been clarified in a simple language,Feedback in this regard is highly appreciated. Take care

input: I had a alt reading about 2+ months ago of 43 then retested today and got a 60 alt reading my other readings came back normal should I be concerned?Im 40 years 5ft 3 and weigh 192albs have a history of chronic vertigo and insomnia, and chronic sinus problems. I take valium 5 mg 4 times a day, fluticansone 2 puffs each nose once a day, qvair two puffs twice a day to prevent weasing, claritin for allergies, and I do sinus rinses as needed. I am female.My doctor says none of the medicine has liver side effects, and I dont drink alcohol but a sip on the rare occasion. He thinks it could be do my weight and Im working on this with gradual exercise when Im able too. Should I be worried with this test result? I had one other result that was high my triglcyerides read 198 ? WWW.WWWW.WW
output: Hello and thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have read your report, and I understand your concerns. First I would say to not worry. Normal Alt levels are 7 to 56 unit (depending on from the kits that laboratories use)In one of your tests, your Alt was 60. This level is almost normal and it doesn't always mean a serious condition of your liver. Here are some reasons why a healthy person might have changes in the levels of liver enzymes:-alcohol-exercise -some medications like aspirin, paracetamol,antibiotics, Cholesterol lowering Chat Doctor. 

input: i had surgery done 5 months ago for scar tissue and adhesion removal. my gynecologist just found a cyst on my right ovary. im still having problems, when my husband and i have sex i get severe cervical pain and afterward i get abdominal cramps severe enough i get light headed, also i get abdominal pain and rectal pain before and during a bowel movement, i also get abdominal pain during urination. im 26 years old. what could it be?
output: Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Understood the history well. You have an obvious reason for pain - the adhesions and scar must have reformed. But the history of Dyspareunia, meaning painful sex indicated the is some active inflammatory process still going on in the pelvis called PID-Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Cystitis and Procto-colitis are the additional problems causing the pain in abdomen and rectum before and during bowel movements as also during urination. Ovarian cyst can cause problem only if it enlarges fast or gets twisted. I would advise you the following::-Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen.-Enteroclysis-Colonoscopy-exploratory Laparoscopy or Laparotomy which will be of diagnostic and therapeutic value. A proper course of an antibiotic, metronidazole, probiotic may help a bit or more.

input: Hi, I had a subarachnoid bleed and coiling of brain aneurysm last year. I am having some major bilateral temple pain along with numbness that comes and goes in my left arm/hand/fingers. I have had headaches since the aneurysm, but this is different. Also, my moods have been horrible for the past few weeks.
output: Aneurysm in brain causes headache due to compression of pain sensitive structure in brain. But pain is usually unilateral not bilateral. This pain will not radiate in both upper limb. Bilateral upper limb pain may be due to cervical spondylosis or other causes. You have anxiety of aneurysm, so due to anxiety your mood is horrible because aneurysm does not cause horrible mood change. So your headache may be chronic tension type headache. You may relieve by antianxiety Chat Doctor. 

input: Almost everytime I eat, it burns when I swallow. Not in my throat but in my chest. It burns all the way down. It helps a lil if I drink water after I swallow. I wake up a lot in the middle of the night with heartburn so I chew some tums and it helps for the most part. Why is it so painful when I eat?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning in chest. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: for the pst  6 days  i have been haing  upper  abdome  distress ...  i have had gall bladder  surgery  2 yrs  ago ..in the past  2  yrs  when i get these bouts  .. i go to  emerg  they run cardiograms  xrays ,blood work ,all comes back normal  ...im stressing out  over this  as im  scared every time it happens  im having a heart  attack  wht is it  ?
output: Hi. Thanks for your query, read and understood your problems. You are getting bouts of pain in the upper abdomen within the last 2 years particularly after the gall bladder surgery. This is great news that cardiac problems are ruled out by the tests every time in the emergency Room. This means that we have to find a local cause in the abdomen itself. I would suggest the following:Get Ct scan and MRCP for the hepato-biliary- pancreatic system. Also go for upper GI Endoscopy to rule out Gastric ulcer. Cancer. Colonoscopy for the possible problem of the colon in this area. If required a diagnostic Laparoscopy may help to see or rule out the intestinal adhesion due to bands or kinking or so and can be tackled at the same time. This way a final diagnosis and treatment plan can be done to get you permanent results.

input: I have a hole its about the size of a dime at the beggining of my butt crack (gross I know) but Im just wondering how to get rid of it at home I put anti bacterial on it with a q - tip it sizzles but nothing comes out or changes . What do I do ? (At home )
output: **1. Opinion and examination with Surgeon is of utmost importance since hole around butt crack could be :1. Pilonidal dimple not transformed into sinus [beginning stage where pain/discharge is not there], so the best management which can be done at home is: keep the area clean and hygienic2. Do not use a cotton bud to scratch, clean or put into hole.3. It could be pressure sore due to prolonged sitting, or old infected boil which opened and left a big hole, thus Opinion/Examination is needed PS. Take care, not at home, but after surgical evaluation and exploration.

output: Hellos you are going in for CSI next month, your doctor has given you Primal N for regulating the cycles. However, in case you have conceived this month, it is not advisable to take Primal N, as it causes virilization of female fetus and other abnormalities in the baby.

input: Hello, I am in the middle of a serious anxiety/panic attack as I just became aware that I may have a tetanus infection. I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary. One toilet was clogged for nearly two months which I now know could have bred bacterial spores that cause tetanus infections. I cut myself shaving around 1 1/2 months ago. I was out of razors and used a razor that had been sitting in the bathroom with the clogged up toilet I mentioned above. I did clean the razor with rubbing alcohol before use however I had an open wound on my face for a while.. About a week. For about a month now I have been feeling extremely irritable, experiencing lockjaw symptoms, been short of breath, had fevers on and off, heart palpitations, and I have noticed that when I smile my face contorts into what one would call a sardonic smile. Am I going to die? Please let me know your opinion
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Tetanus is a bacterial disease by clostridium retain. There is no cure for tetanus, but it can be prevented by adequate vaccination. Usual symptoms are all due to painful contraction of muscles as it affects our nervous system. Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles, stiffness of your neck muscles, difficulty swallowing, stiffness of your abdominal muscles, painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically frittered by minor occurrences, such as a Chat Doctor. If you are not get immunized for tetanus, you should start tetanus toxic vaccination now itself. First 2 doses at 4 weeks apart. Third dose after 6 months. After that your immunity may stand up to 10 years. Thank you.

input: Hi hope you can helpive been getting chest pains, not severe but a constant pain, can happen when im just resting but has also happened when im exercising, it continues through to my back as well. I sometimes wake up with chest pains too. i have a strong history of heart disease. grandfather died at 26 from a heat attack and mother had one at 45, also grandmother on the other side had a heart attack. Could you please explain what is happening? Thanks
output: HelloThanks for posting at Chat Doctor. You have not provided your age on the details. I would have been able to help u better had you mentioned your age. You have complaints of chest pain radiating to back with strong family history. So in your case it is better that we evaluate you for presence of heart disease. I recommend an ECG and 2d echo initially. If both these tests are normal you can proceed for a treadmill test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously monitored. This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert. Wishing you good healthRegards.

I started using RICHFEEL tricology centres saw palmetto treatment but it didnt help, then I tried Minoxidil 5%  but discontinued it after 12 days after having some side effects (some tiny boils on my forehead). Kindly suggest me which medicine i should take.
output: Hi, You may stop it for a few days. Take oral treatment like tab finasteride 1 mg daily with tab biotin 10 mg thrice a day. Cleanse the scalp with ketoconazole shampoo daily.

output: Welcome to ChatDoctorYou may be having rib fractures. You have to do x-ray chest as early as possible. Rib fractures can cause pneumothorax/air in chest or hemothorax/blood in the chest which will be seen on x-ray. Only rib fractures needs no treatment except painkillers. But if pseudo or hemothorax is present that needs ICD tube insertion in the chest. In that case air travel should be avoided. Regards

input: I have had a few small hard painless bumps where my cheek goes to my gums. this may sound terrible but they have been there, the same size & number for about a year if I remember correctly (scratch that, I just talked with a friend of mine & remebered they have been there for four years) & I have yet to tell my dentist about them. any thoughts? I am a 16 yr. old male & have used snuff habitually before, for only a few years but none the less.
output: Taking snuff for a prolonged period is not known to cause cancer, but it may lead to a number of local infections. Also, such people have a number of vitamin deficiencies which may also lead to irregularities in the cheeks and gums. I would advise you to take an antibiotic and antifungal (Tab Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily +Tab For can 150 mg twice daily) plus a multivitamin (Tab B-Complex twice daily), all for 15 days. If your bumps don't improve by then, you should consult a surgeon.

output: Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor ! Lower back pain may cause by right lumber disc prolapse whicChatDoctorpresses the nerve. But exact other causes are diagnosed by physical examination or by MRI. Common causes of lower backache and leg pain is a lumbar ruptured disc or herniated disc. Symptoms of a herniated disc may include dull or sharp pain, muscle spasm or cramping, sciatica, and leg weakness or loss of leg function. Sneezing, coughing, or bending usually intensify the pain. Rarely bowel or bladder control is lost, and if this occurs, seek medical attention at once. Sciatica is a symptom frequently associated with a lumbar herniated disc. Pressure on one or several nerves that contribute to the sciatic nerve can cause pain, burning, tingling, and numbness that extends from the buttock into the leg and sometimes into the foot. Usually one side (left or right) is affected. Take care

No fever the whole time. Xray was clear on lungs. Taking mucinex, third antibiotic, inhaler and can not get better. Ulcers in mouth and my face in breaking out bad. Been sick since December 28,2012.
output: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The reasons for persistent cough, without findings in the lungs might, Uveitis a growth at the end of the throat, by touching the pharynx cause severe cough. For this type of cough you need to use cough suppressants like dexametarphane, codeine, etc which are present in some cough syrups.  Best thing to get relief immediately is Darling with Luke warm salt water 2 or 3 times a day. Avoid taking fruits, juices, ice creams, ice water to Chat Doctor.  I advise you to consult an E.N.T.surgeon who is the doctor concerned with the causes in the pharynx.  Wishing for a quick and comfortable relief, and thanks for calling.

She has now got this bruising appearing around her lower back too, and i don t know how its been caused. I m really worried about her. Is this seriouse?
output: Hello, I would explain that a heart murmur could be related a structural heart abnormality.  For this reason, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound and a resting ECG in order to examine her heart function and structure.  Considering her blackout attacks, I would recommend performing some tests too:- complete blood count for anemia,- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance.  An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help examine her heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia.  Hope I have answered your query.

output: Hi, From history it seems that there might be having something with liver. There might be having possibility of having gall bladder stones.

input: I stopped taking microgestin, mid-pack, on 12/5/13 after being on it for 2 1/2 months. I had withdrawal bleeding 12/9/13 - 12/13/13.I was supposed to get my period 1/5/14 but i am late. Before birth control my cycles were always regular and always 28-29 days. My boyfriend and i have been using the pullout method frequently before and after stopping the pill. Could i be pregnant?
output: Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.  However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue.

You must know that acute hepatitis E is a self limiting disease, only needs supportive care. You are correctly started on Mongolia (UCA), please continue that, no need to change to Liv 52. Furthermore, you may also require acid suppressing and antiemetic tablets like - Antacid DSR along with some vitamin supplements. Have good quality food with necessary proteins and vitamins. You will become normal in another weak. Mind you bilirubin is the last thing to normalize. So don't worry about that. Alarm signs which one should keep in mind are - excessive sleepiness, bleeding manifestations and inability to eat anything. Take care.

ESR and liver test 3. Urine Routine 4. Blood Group & Rh Factor 5. X-ray (Chest)6. General Physical Examination7. Fasting Blood Sugar &Post Prandial Blood Sugar8. Total Cholesterol9. ECG10. Serum Creatininenow they have advised me to got my ultrasound done full abdomen. i have got it done today and every thing is normal and they found mild fatty liver. Another thing i want to share that i was suffering from loose motions and was on Ofloxacin-200mg with ornidazole500mg B.D dosage (oflox OZ )medication for 2days and continued ofloxacin-200 B.D dosage (oflox) for another 3days as was suffering cold and cough also.now i need to go to gastro doctor to get the ultrasound reports checked. Just want to know what could be the reason for this elevated SGPT and will i get the clearance for joining new company.what should i do to lower my SGPT levels?? and what diet i should follow i am not a heavy drinker just take drinks occasionally and i am not fond of junk food as well.
output: Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!

input: Hello, My name is Wanda I am a 40year old female with type one diabetes (have had it for 7 years ) I have had a tooth infection in my gums for honestly on and off for about 2 years it swells up then bursts with yellowish clear pus above a tooth which needs to be pulled. I have felt like Ive had a sinus cold for the past few weeks and then discovered a sore on the inside of my left nostil.. could they be connected
output: Hello Wanda and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. The roots of upper molars are in very proximity with the maxillary sinus above.Therefore, sometimes it becomes difficult to diagnose whether the patient presents pain due to tooth infection or sinusitis. But clinical evaluation with supporting x-rays makes it clear whether the origin of infection is teeth or sinus.Therefore, in my view please meet your dentist/ENT specialist for a sinus view x-ray. This will make things pretty clear.Meanwhile, do take good care of yourself.ET us know for further doubts. Thanks. Take care.

input: I had a partial root canal roughly 36 hours ago on my lower left rear molar (wisdom teeth extracted years ago).  The doctor drilled out the pulp (noting that it was mostly dead) and put on a temporary filling until the root canal specialist could see me.  Now, about 36 hours later, Im in quite a bit of pain again, both on the tooth that was operated on and in a molar on the top of my jaw and in the back jaw muscle.  My neck is rather swollen too and is tender to the touch.  I have plans to travel tomorrow by plane to see some family and go diving.  Is my condition something that requires immediate attention?  Should I not be flying or diving?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Dead pulp inside a root canal is almost always infected with several bacteria. Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125 mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac.  Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days. Best wishes.

input: My doctor had issue with finding the baby during my transvaginal ultrasound is that because I had to pee she could see the yoke sac and I measured 9 weeks but what she thought was the baby was measuring 7 weeks. I am just worried and want to know if that interfered
output: Hello,First, do not panic. As you might be aware that yolk sac is a structure attached with an embryo-baby, for its nutrition in early pregnancy. The reason for not finding the baby and only finding the yolk sac can be small pregnancy duration may be due to delayed ovulation and delayed conception.

There is only pain when I move my hand. Thank you.
output: Dear patient You must have injured wrist ligament due to extreme stretching while playing and this is leading to pain. Still possibility of fracture needs to be ruled out, and I would advise X-ray of involved wrist with hand anteroposterior and lateral views.  Visit radiology center nearby you and get it done. If report is normal diagnosis is wrist sprain.  Avoid game for 2 weeks and apply wrist binder for 3 weeks. Start tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for 5 days for pain relief. If X-ray report is abnormal you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon with report.

input: I have a pacemaker, due to atrial fibrillation, and have been put on coumadin. It does not seem to thin my blood, and am on 750 mg a day, and it makes me nauseous and extremely dizzy, to the point where I can t function. Are there any foods that help thin the blood? Also, do fish oils help or hinder the thinning process? I would really like to take less medication and get results that are favorable.
output: Hi, Green leafy vegetables like spinach, broccoli and food rich in vitamin K antagonize the effect of medicine. So these should be consumed in moderate amount, since we can't stop green vegetables altogether. And importantly, daily this intake should be kept constant otherwise effects may fluctuate.  Fish doesn't have significant effect on Chat Doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hi there My husband has a brain tumor, it is very rare and is called Condrosarcoma. In May 2011 when it was diagnosed it was as big as my fist. A local Neurosurgeon took a biopsy and could only remove a 3rd of the tumor. He had radiation for about 2 months every day, but it does not seem like the tumor is dying. It has gone into every little opening expl his sinus openings ext. Is there anything that you can do for him?

input: Hi Over the past 2 days I have had a sore jaw on the right side only. Doesn t feel sore on the outside of my face, but extremely tender on the tendon that attaches jaw together. Inside of cheek also appears swollen. Right side of tongue feels strange, and slightly sore to swallow also. I m 40 but my wisdom teeth never came in, could this be a cause?
output: Hello, I can understand your concern. Usually, wisdom teetChatDoctore in mouth at the age of 18 to 25 years. However, as you have never had them in mouth, it is possible that they might be impacted or locked in the jaw. As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. It is also a possibility that a tooth might be decayed on the side of the jaw that is causing you problems, has developed an abscess that is causing these symptoms. In both cases, you need to visit a dentist to get an oral examination to find out if any tooth is decayed and taking x-ray of the wisdom tooth area to diagnose wisdom tooth related problem. By the time you ET an appointment of the dentist, Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice a day will help you in getting relief from pain. Please refrain from hot water gargles or heat compression as if the pain would be abscess related, it would worsen. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,

input: Hi, Can anyone give me the solution for Aplastic Anemia ? my 4 years old daughter suffering from Aplastic anemia since April 2010. Regards, Vinod
output: Dear Vinod:Thanks for the query. There are different modalities. The treatments depend on severity of the problem. If it is less severe the immune-modulator medications-Antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin (CSA), and cyclophosphamide are useful. She requires intermittent blood transfusions. If it is more severe, she needs Bone Marrow transplantation (BMT) from appropriate donor which is the definitive treatment. She needs conditioning before transplantation with ATG/cyclophosphamide so that the graft (BMT) will not be rejected.

input: Lately I have been having the feeling of pounding in my chest at night when I lie down to sleep.  Usually an hour into lying down.  I never have heartburn and I have never had symptoms other than possibly this one but I think this might be GERD.  Im 34, female, a healthy weight, eat healthy -lots of fruit, veggies, and work out 3-4 times a weight with cardio and weights and yoga.  I believe this is GERD at night because I tested taking zantac a few times and the pounding did not happen.  I havent been eating too close to bed - eat about 2-3 hours before bed, and usually have salad. I think possibly its my birth control.  I take birth control right before I go to sleep at night on an empty stomach.  i am wondering if maybe switching that to daytime use and having it with lunch with get rid of symptoms.  Could the birth control be the cause?  I recently had a checkup and I was fully heathy, my blood test had all my vitamins and minerals in the normal range and my heart checked out.
output: Possible it is HERD as you are suspecting. Try taking the medication with food as well as take antacid every night for a period of a week. Also try to elevate your head end by extra pillows at night. Might give you some relief.

input: I fell down three stairs on my buttocks, when I got up I almost passed out I ran to my bed and waited till I felt better. I have been feeling nauseated since then and cant stand for a long period of time without feeling like im going to be sick. It is also painful to sit. Im on blood thinners what should I do?
output: Dear France pain is from muscular strain due to injury. You can take analgesic like ibuprofen or if severe pain take combination of diclofenac+paracetamol+chlorzoxazon/serratiopeptidase with omeprazole/pantoprazole + risperidone to relieve nausea for 2-3 days. This will clear all symptoms. If symptoms are severe consult your family doctor first. Hope this answer will be helpful to you. For more queries please don't hesitate to ask. Get well soon.

input: Do you take multiple chemical sensitivities seriously and understand how debilitating fragrance chemicals are? Do you think there is always an under-lying cause for scent sensitivity/allergy (yes, I have allergic reactions to dryer sheets like Bounce and Scent Boosters)ie rash hot prickly skin, swelling of tongue, extreme thirst... do you think (my) immune system was already compromised or do you think the neurotoxic petro chemicals in fragrance products alone can cut a person s life down to the knees overnight?
output: It's a very good question and thousands of people who read it, I fact, can reap the benefits out of suggestions given herein, based on the principles of Ayurveda - the nascent science of life.First there is a principle cited in Ayurveda about how to prevent/ cure a disease. Its NIDAANPARIVARJAN (in Sanskrit language) which literally means avoidance of the cause. Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to remain in such conditions. Here comes the principle of PRAANVAYU (richness of oxygen and fresh air) that is achieved by rhythms of deep breathing exercises called PRAANAYAM. Indias Yoga has spread to the World and people who are aware are enjoying the benefits. It enhances immunity, gives strength to fight allergens and extends life as also betters quality of life. Then there are herbs to naturally support the fight of body against allergens. Simple herbs like Turmeric, Need, Manisha, Gilroy, Quasi (Holy basil) etc. not only counter allergens but detoxifies the blood and also raise natural immunity. The hitch among beginners is its slow pace of action. Yes naturals are slow as compared to man made synthetic and toxic medicines but then what advantage has these fast Chat Doctor.  No doubt modern synthetics have won in emergency situations and saved lives. But lifestyle disorders and the one you are suffering from needs naturals to support you. These do not have side effects, no interaction with 

input: dear doctor, in hot and humid weather my 5 year old get some sort of pimples here and there on her body....i hv put her on homeopathy and also put spirit on it which prevents pimple from growing further....shown her to her paeditrician who saying she just has sensitive skin and hasnt given her medicine...homeopathy is specifically for staphlococci bacteria.....doctor feels i dnt need a blood test....will the problem go away in a few days with homeopathy and spirit application...i worry abt extreme situations like bacteia contaminating blood etc....am i just overdoing it as she absolutely fine and no fever or discomfort....she tuchwud fine and just sweats a lot due to humidity.....pl tell is this common in kids and any cause to worry...hope nothing infects blood as no major medication gvn by doctor
output: Hi, Is she having fever? How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: Hi doctor, i feel some times tremors in my hands (not regularly my hand are shaken..some times i feel very normal)..i.e while signing or filling bank cheque, while handling dinner plates in any family function, while taking cup of tea or coffee and most important is sometimes i am unable to pick up any food item from plate when some body is near or when i feel nervous..to all the symptoms i have reported to psychiatrist in Vimhans institute in New Delhi..he advise me to take betacap-20 mg (Beta propranolol ) after morning meals but while taking from last 20 days i am still not feeling any improvement (sometimes shaking proceed as usual) whether it is Parkinson or any kind of depression or still should i increase dose of betacap 20 mg and make it to 40 mg..please advise what to do...Satya
output: Hi.intention tremor may also be of neurological origin.so please consult a neurologist.propranolol is a good choice for tremor of any origin, but there are certain problems of increasing dose in case of hypotension or asthma.so before increment, please consult your psychiatrist. Parkinsonism usually presents with rest tremor, rigidity, slowness.so these are in need of assessment.have a good health

input: Hello,A little over 2 weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a girl that I knew for some time. The sex was very very rough. She was on top the whole time riding back and forth. The next morning I felt a little soreness/tingle in my penis. I thought it was just regular soreness and it will fade away in a day or so. The problem continued for 1.5 weeks. At that point I went to the doc to get STD test and doc prescribed me with anti-biotics. I took some doxycycline for 6 days. And I must admit, I do feel a little better. I went back to doc the following week for my results. Test came back negative. Doc said to finish the treatment, it can be a UTI. I do not have the classic uti symptons. It does not burn when I pee, and I dont have much of an urge to pee. I just have a mild penis discomfort. Just a feeling that it is not 100% normal yet. My question, can this feeling just be from having really rough rough sex? I havnt been sexually active at the time we had sex, and she was really rough.
output: Hello, Yes, it could be due to a rough sex, but it was a better idea to get tested too for sexually transmitted infections and UTI as well. Your doctor did the right thing to test you and give you antibiotics. Take plenty of water and avoid sex till you get better. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: My 1 year old has a purplish bump on her butt-ox. When my wife pushed down on it last night white/red puss came out of it and it went down a little. Well it filled back up and wont release again? Should we wait until tomorrow and try again and then schedule a Dr. Appointment or go ahead and take her to the ER?
output: Hi...it could be an abscess. I suggest you not to wait and get the kid to the nearest physician or nearest emergency room as this might require antibiotic prescription. If it spreads it can become a skin and soft tissue infection. Regards - 

input: Hello its since 11 days that we had unprotected sex on 7 may though I ejaculated outside bt m feeling tensed about this. Her last period was on 22nd April. She had vomited in these days though it had stopped now. Am very tensed and shes also. What should we do.? Can we avail pregnancy urine test at home now. Its 18 may today n she normally mensturates at 26 days interval......help us.
output: Hello, thanks for writing in. I understand your anxiety. The pull-out method is not 100% foolproof. If your partner has a 26-day cycle, it means she would be due around the 18th. A delay does not always mean a pregnancy, it can also be due to the mental anxiety, illness etc. She can test for a pregnancy using a home pregnancy kit about 4-5 days after the date of the missed period (assuming she has regular cycles). Ask her to use a morning sample preferably. If there is a doubt, better do a pelvic ultrasound the week after. Do not worry, seek a gynecologist opinion in case it is positive. All the best.

input: i have just been diagnosed with possible glandular fever or tonsilitus, i am taking 8 penicillin a day as perscribed but now my gums are swollen and hurt on the left side of my mouth where i had my wisdom teeth removed about 6 months ago.  will the penicillin treat the gum issue too?
output: Thanks for the query, penicillin is effective in tooth infection but if it is gum infection then you can go for doxycycline or metronidazole...first consult an oral physician to confirm whether the pain is because of gum infection or some bone spicule or remnant of tooth root...take radiograph and rule out.I hope my answer will help you.

input: My son had fits in his sleep at early morning for the first time. He is 8 years 5 months old. Fits was around 3 minutes and he went to unconsious later for another 2 to 3 minutes. When he got conscious he does not remember any. He was having veeze problems from few days and was on medication. We checked in the family and cleared not a heridity issue. I am very concerned and seeking your help to understand the situation.
output: Hi...by what you quote this seems to be a type of seizure called complex partial seizure (CPS) or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This is not related to wheeze or its related medications. As it has occurred for the first time, without anybody in the family having it, he definitely needs evaluation. He will need a basic blood work up and EEG and MRI brain. Nothing to worry, if he is stable now. The tests will throw light upon the probable cause and then the doctors will be in a better to counsel you on further proceedings and prognosis. Regards -

input: Hi, i ve been on the Noriday pill for 10 months now (i was on the Depo Injection prior to it), i started having heavy periods at the start of December and i m on my fourth period now. Is this normal for this pill? The reason i went on this particular one was because it was similiar to the Depo Injection. I didnt get any periods with the Depo.
output: Hi, Thanks for the query. Holiday pill is a mini pill containing progesterone. During the usage of contraceptive pills some amount of irregularity in menstrual flow is common. If you are having heavy bleeding, you can take symptomatic treatment for that and can continue the pills. If same problem repeats frequently better to think of changing the contraceptive method. You discuss this with your doctor and proceed according to her advice. Take care.

output: Welcome to ChatDoctorYou should see a ENT surgeon the earliest possible. I cannot definitely tell the diagnosis on the basis of information that you have given. Smoking definitely increases the risk of throat cancer and not always it will be with blood in cough. So you should not wait till that. Regards.

output: HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctorIf you having pain after 3 weeks of fall an injury like fracture should be ruled out. A x-ray should be taken according to the point of tenderness.

output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastronomic reflux. It is quite common for kids to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the kid takes feeds, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

input: I feel as though there is a liquid near the surface of my upper left chest muscle near the arm pit that burns when I lean foreword in a standing position. The burn is very intense like a white hot iron is slouching in that area. just started 4 hours ago and is increasing in area. feels liquid in nature, but i feel no bump and it may be inside rib at that location? do not feel it by putting finger pressure in general area.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should first get done 1. Chest x-ray 2.  Ultrasound examination of local part. Lung infection or skin infection (left upper chest area) can cause symptoms of burning and fluid sensation. If both these are normal then no need to worry about major diseases. Also get done vitamin B 12 level, hemoglobin estimation as b 12 deficiency and anemia can give rise to similar sensation. If any of these are deficient then you need supplements. Don't worry, you will be alright.

output: Hi, Having fishy odor with pain might be due to some irritation produced by itching on the part. This can be due to local unhealthy hygiene. Clean local part with water and apply antibiotic cream. Make a habit of cleaning local part with running water after passing bowel and urination. Do not allow her to play in clay or dusty playground.

Tightness still in my ankle and sometimes some pain. I do put my leg up often and use a compression stocking. Antibiotics have not been effective.

We call this machine IT [inter-ferential therapy]. An experienced Physiotherapy will give you IT treatment at a frequency of 70-100 and if pain is there 20-30 frequency current would be used.in the meantime you can start calf stretching to activate "pumping mechanism" of your calf muscles as Calf muscle is called as HEART of lower body. So once these muscles get activated swelling would not e a problem anymore. Also try Isometric exercises of calf muscle. I am hoping a speedy recovery for you. Regards

input: I had a laparoscopic appendectomy 4 weeks ago. My abdomen is not bloated and I am not experiencing gas problems, but the area around my navel feels very tight. Additionally, my appetite has decreased significantly post operation and my stomach feels upset after I finish a meal. Are these problems normal following my procedure? I went for a post-op checkup two weeks following the operation and the surgeon thought that all looked very well.
output: Hi Thanks for writing in Usually after Laparoscopic surgery the port around the umbilicus is closed in layers to prevent port herniation As a result is mat appear tight for around 4 to 6 weeks If after that it remains so and there are other symptoms you should go for an ultrasound Add a probiotic twice a day and an antacid to prevent post radial pain Hope this helped well soon

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should start oral bronchodilators. There are many good oral bronchodilators available. 1. Theophylline derivatives like acebrophyllin, doxophyllin etc2. BambuterolYou can also try antiallergic and antihistamine tablet once in night. Better to give her LAB (Long Acting Beta 2 Agonist) and ICS (Inhaled corticosteroids) as they are long acting and gives relief for almost 12 hours, while Stalin gives only relief for 3-4 hours.

input: hi my dad is 67 but had a heart attack 11years ago. He has diabeiteis, high blood pressure and rheumatoid arthritis. Hes been retaining water alot more over the last few months and has had several hospital visits to help pass out the extra water that the medication hes taking is not doing fast enough. They say his heart is working at 10% now, he has a difibulator which didnt shock him back in december when he lost consciousness due to a lack of oxygen to the brain. We do believe he is having renal problems as well but the doctors take blood test and say  its fine. Whats the likely hood of life expectancy when his heart is so weak?
output: Not long, unfortunately.as 10% efficacy is too low for the heart to do his proper work and supply the blood requirements for the whole body...it ranges from few months to a year...

input: Trying to conceive for over a year now and just started tracking my basil body temp to see if I ovulate. My doctor said that when it s at it s lowest is when you are ovulating and then it increases right after that. While my temp was at it s lowest and I thought I could be ovulating I also did a few ovulation predictor tests each day and they all said negative so now I m not sure what to think. Is there any other type of test you can do to check and see if you re ovulating and/or are ovulation predictions tests accurate? I have tried ovulation predictors before and they have never read positive but why would my temp drop like it did earlier this month (and I wasn t sick or anything)?
output: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The ovulation predictor kits are a more accurate to identify the time of ovulation rather than a basal body temperature method. The BBT depends on the progesterone levels of the body while LH surge kit detects the high level of LH in urine. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

input: I got onto a 4 wheeler the other day and a metal bar scraped the back of my calf.  It was scaped pretty bad and was tender for about a week very soon after now there is a few lumps "knots" throughout the area where the scrape occured and the knots are tender to the touch. Any idea what this could be and will it go away?

input: My 3 year old daughter complains headache and throat pain since yesterday. Shes also having a hard time sleeping right now. She doesnt have fever but shes asking for blanket, telling me shes cold but were in a tropical-hot country and its really humid-hot right now, so Im really concerned if shes alright.
output: Welcome to the ChatDoctorI completely understand your concerns but don't worry. The most likely reason for these symptoms are self limiting viral infections. They just need symptomatic treatment. I recommend the following for such cases:-Acetaminophen for fever spikes and throat pain.-Warm saline gargles with antihistamine such as Chlorpheniramine or Ben Chat Doctor.  This will relieve the throat infection.- since the sinus congestion is most likely reason for associated headache, steam inhalation or use of humidifiers during sleep are useful remedies.- use antibiotics after throat swab culture for streptococcal infection if the symptoms are severe and fever spikes occur. Hopefully this will be helpful. Take care

input: Hello, I recently developed a very itchy penis which when I itch, leads to red patchs which sometimes become red and glossy. It is very irritable and causes pain when i have intercourse. I also have developed itchy thighs.. It started just at the top and has now developed over most of my thighs. The itching comes and goes and shows in small patches , not lumps but itchy red spots. i am worried that it is an std as i have had a lot of unprotected sex recently (lesson learnt) but the symptoms don t relate to any std so i m puzzled!? i also have what i thought was joggers nipple? very itchy nipple and also my face sometimes has dry patches on the eyelids and near the hair receding line? It has been going on for the last 3 months and as i m still in China and not a native speaker, i can t really find any treatment or diagnosis. please help?
output: HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI can understand this, these are two different conditions and that might not be due to unsafe intercourse, but this could be some allergic rash might have developed at the same time in two different areas, just wait till few more days the chances of getting alright on its own is likely, if this does not go away, then you can use "Tab Levocetrizine 10 mg three times in day" hope this information helps you, have a nice day.

input: Hi, I was just at the dentist and they discovered a black area on the left lower jaw area below my teeth and they called me back and said I should go get a CT scan. I am 23 years old and otherwise healthy, is cancer the only thing this could be? I had a root canal re done last year on that same side but this black area isnt underneath that tooth it is along the other ones next to it.
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your quarry. Cancer is the less common thing that could be. Tooth tumors are rare especially in your age, but it must be ruled out of course. It can be any benign mass, abscess, tooth tissue, neuroma, or calcification. CT would show exact size and signs of infiltration but i don't think it would be serious. Even if this is, it can be surgical managed. Wish you good health.

input: Good Morning,When i was cleaning toilet,I have mixed Harpic and Bleach almost 250 Ml,It created  a  fume and i exposed in it,almost 3 hrs i was sneezing and coughing and felt dizziness,Now its almost one moth over,But still i am sneezing ang coughing in the morning and night time with heavily clogged nose and extreme amouunt of puss/cougChatDoctores from nose as well.Is it a disease caused by the exposure.Kindly let me know.
output: Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. I will try to explain to you that how this occurs. When there was fume (smoke) due to reaction of bleach +Harris, it entered in your lungs through inhalation, and you developed allergy. This fume was a predisposing factor, otherwise your lungs were already sensitive to allergy. Due to this allergy there develops, coughing, sneezing, tears from eyes, red eyes, nasal discharge, itching in eyes and over face. Due to these symptoms you got infection and this produces expectoration (phlegm or pus in your words). Please don't worry, be tension free, this sort of allergy is very common. Consult a physician and take treatment, once alright (cure), forget, again allergy take treatment. Antihistamine + bronchodilator helps in this type of condition. If infection than take antibiotics. Good luck. 

input: Hi, I am 19 year old and have been mastubrating since the age of 8. I am a bit light weight for my age and also, my back pains a lot. Is it due to mastubration? Cause i have a healthy diet and was born very healthy. And how should I overcome these effects.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Masturbation i not sin or is dangerous. Masturbation cannot make you sick or unhealthy. It is natural and even animals do it. In saying that you started masturbation at the age of 8 is a bit exaggerating. Puberty is attained after around 11. Masturbation before that cannot produce the desired result. Secondly, Masturbation cannot make you thin. But the anxiety associated with it can make you thin. If you are able to take proper nutritious and healthy food, then you should not be thin. Inspire, if you are thin, either you have some anxiety disorders or some wasting diseases like anemia. Consult a doctor to diagnose. For psychological or sexological counseling visit http://psychocure.webs.com. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

Make necessary lifestyle modifications like avoiding stress, practicing yoga/ meditation. Take care

output: Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. Both Tenor and Movie contain equal amounts of Ethinodiol acetate and Ethanol estradiol. The acceptability of oral contraceptive preparations in various individuals differ from each other. Therapeutically both preparations are found to be equally effective. According to surveys conducted, the order of side effects reported by people using Tenor 35 is nausea, bloating, anxiety, breast pain and depression whereas for Movie 35 the order is depression, anxiety, bloating, dizziness and breast pain. Since both are hormonal preparations, these side effects are expected. The symptoms of depression you have, is suggestive of movie. Although it takes some time for a person to get adjusted to any new preparation of medication when you switch over from one brand to the other, if these symptoms continue or become severe, then you should consult your treating

I had the cyst on the right side when they drained the one last july but they did not drain it then, they did not think it was a problem.
output: Hello!nausea and vomiting is a feature of uremia, i.e. when urea and creatinine rises in the body. I think because of your cyst problem, you must be having some renal insufficiency. Check your renal parameters, and then you will be able to find out the right cause. Thanks

input: Hi, I get upper abdominal pain occasionally (maybe every couple of months?) and it lasts for 2-4 days at a time. It is right at the bottom of my ribcage, pretty much in the center. It only bothers me when I m standing or walking, to the point that I start feeling miserable or even nauseous. However, as soon as I sit down it pretty much goes away instantly. I also seem to feel like I need to belch more when this happens. I have tried everything, antacids, gas-x, pepto, pain relievers, nothing helps, it just has to go away on it s own after a couple days. I have gone to my local clinic after symptoms stopped and was seen by the RN, but nothing was done since the pain had stopped. What could this be??

input: Isn t it true that sharp pain in one s right shoulder could indicate parasites in the small and/or large intestines (i.e. amoebic dysentery) which could be seen by the host (amoebic cysts and trophozoites...all stages of development) in one s stool, cause bloating, gas, stomach distention, terrible abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and progressively get worse if not treated with the appropriate antibiotics and eventually cause the death of the host? Fact or Fiction: Amoebic dysentery has been eradicated in North America. Amoeba and trophozoites cannot be seen by the naked eye. Amoeba generally float on top of the toilet water, easily visible. Standard O&P lab tests cannot detect amoebas and trophozoites. The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease. Two or more antibiotics will be necessary to eliminate such parasites; long term if the host has been infected over a long period of time. Thank you, Edward DeBusman
output: Hi, There is no direct relationship between intestinal infection and shoulder pain. Reasons for both are entirely different. The intestinal infection will lead to diarrhea, bloating and indigestion but not shoulder pain. Reason for shoulder pain may be muscular pain or joint abnormalities. A detailed clinical examination is needed to assess the cause of shoulder pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: i have had many signs and symptoms of pregnancy like a lte period getting sick the veins on my sides are very noticable and on my arms and chest and legs but i took a test it came back negative and then i was a week late but after that i got my period. is there any way i could still be pregnant? i also have leg cramps and pains in my arms too
output: Hallow Dear, The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy to appear is missing a period. All other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and the breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discoloration of nipples & areola with widening of areola and secretions through nipples appear subsequently, usually 10 to 15 days after missed period. Though you had some vague symptoms, ultimately you have got your menses. Probably after having the menses, the symptoms also might have vanished. When in doubt, urine examination for pregnancy gives clue. That also is negative in your case. So Madam, no missed period and pregnancy test negatives confirms that you are not pregnant. 

input: 40yr old. Had a fertility test 2.5 years ago (results normal) but have had significant psychological trauma since then and continues now. I gave a sample again this week (extreme stress during abstinence also) and the comparison is as follows: Then: volume 5.0, concentration 31, normal 18%, motility (40% rapid, 20%, 20%, 20% imotile). Now: volume 4.5, concentration 14, normal 19%, motility (5% rapid, 5%, 40%, 50% imotile). I discovered last year that I have varicocele but otherwise had no other known physical obstacles or injuries. Is this massive loss normal in such a short period? Should I repeat the test? Can it be the stress? Is it temporary or permanent? Thank you, Tom J
output: Hi, varicocele treated surgically because it can lead to infertility. Here massive change in second result, so I will advise repeat test for making sure of second result. Thanks

input: Hi, I am 23 years old, cannot grow much facial hair at all. It is really depressing. It makes me feel quite anxious, I have a normal amount of pubic hair, I guess medium hair on my legs and armpits (not worried there), but very little hair on my arms at all. Hardly any on my hands and feet. With just a little (very little) on my chin and mustache. I have a normal-high sex drive and a girlfriend who is older, it doesnt bother her, but it does bother me. Im not sure about genetic disposition really, except that my father claims he wasnt that hairy at my age. I am also quite short 58-9 or so but my mother is very short so.. I was wondering could my seemingly slow/late development be from cigarettes or daily masturbation? I guess I am very habitual (you could say an addict) I try to stop the behavior but its easier said than done. Anyways, any negative effects from that could it be causing it, should I be worried? I seem to be pretty normal in my feelings just not my development... I was always slower than classmates as well when I was younger. Thanks for your help.

output: Hello, I would explain that as the CT scan is normal, there is nothing to worry about.

input: For the past 8 months or so when I start my menstrual period a lump appears in my lower left abdomen. And the lump is very painful at times. Sometimes it hurts so bad I cannot walk. I went to two different ers and they said it was hematomen. If its a bruise then why is it reoccurring? Can you please help me find out what is reallywrong and how I csn get it treated
output: Hi and thanks for the query, I am sorry to suggest again that this needs another clinical evaluation. It could really be a hematoma. However, it could be very interesting and informative doing an ultrasound. This would give an idea of the echo structure and borders of the mass. This is important because if there is an associated cyst, it would be important that it should be removed. A possible infection of this mass of hematoma must be considered. Aspirating the mass content and running some tests for infections and inflammation to me shall be very appropriate. I suggest you consult you primary care physician again for reevaluation. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.

input: My husband started taking Maetanx about 3 - 4 weeks ago, which was prescribed by his dr.  He had not been taking any meds for neuropathy at the time because so far none of the meds he was prescribed helped.  Now, the pain seems to be worse than when he was not taking anything for the pain.  Should we call the dr. and stop taking Metanx or give it more time.  When I talked to  at nurse at the company where we had to get the prescription she said it could take 3 weeks to 4 months for it to take affect but should it get worse before it gets better?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. Metanx is a medical food made that contains L-methylfolate (vitamin B9), methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and pyridoxine 5-phosphate (vitamin B6). It is a vitamin B supplement. Treatment is on right way for neuropathy, but you have to be watchful for your sugar level. You have to take oral as well as intramuscular NSAID to subside pain. Gabapentin will be useful. Ask your doctor about your pain and further management.

I have had some life changes (seperation, moving to new house, extra debt to support expanding business)but nothing I would consider unmanageable. Any advice? I have setup a health exam with my doctor in September? Could this be physical or phsychological? Any advice from past experiencees?Thanks!
output: Hello welcome to Ask A Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You have to rule out anemia first by he estimation. I suggest you to investigate with serum calcium, serum sodium, potassium estimation, serum TSH estimation for primary work up. Got, Sept, urea, creatinine also investigated as toxic metabolite accumulation also sometime can lead fatigue. You are absolutely right in a way that fatigue can be from exhaustion, overwork, lack of sleep etc. Revert with above reports to guide you further. Hope I have solved your query.

input: I believe I have an Essential Tremor.  My head shakes when I am nervous and most of the time I am not in touch with it.  My family has mentioned it a number of times & are concerned.

input: Hi, I have taken a solid hit to my lower back on my left side (I think my kidney) it has been painful for 2 weeks now and is sore mostly when I bend or apply tension to the muscles in that area. I have not urinated blood Improvement in past 2 weeks seems minimal Please advise
output: Hello, Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor about your query, Brief Answer -Treatment for lower back pain depends upon the patients history and the type and severity of pain, as you described I explained below meditation. Explained Answer -The vast majority of lower back pain cases get better within six weeks without surgery, and lower back pain exercises are almost always part of a treatment plan. If pain persists or worsens, more involved diagnostic and surgical procedures may be recommended.  Medications : A wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications is available to help reduce symptoms of lower back pain. Many medications reduce inflammation, which is often a cause of pain, while others work to inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain. Each medication has multiple unique risks, possible side effects and Chat Doctor. Also, I would suggest Rest for some time more because Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve lower back pain. However, more than a few days of rest can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the spine. Patients who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. Hope You will find it out helpful. Thanks And

output: Hi, After going through the entire description, I am of the opinion that the cause for your pain is infection. A tooth abscess won't resolve without treatment. Even if the abscess disperses, bursts or Chat Doctor.  Antibiotics kill the germs responsible for tooth abscesses, helping the body to repair the tooth and bone. If an abscess erupts by itself, warm salt-water rinses will soothe, help clean the mouth and encourage

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here I am 65 years old and for the past 12 months I have had a persistant cough that is quite forceful. It makes my ees water and I am quite short of breathe for a period of time after.  The secretions I clear and thick with bubbles in it.  I am also very tired.  Please can you give me some insight?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having chronic cough, expectoration which are difficult to cough out and breathlessness. All these symptoms are characteristic of bronchitis. So get done chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out other lung diseases. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol), N acetyl cysteine (NAC) and bucolic with expectorant syrup. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: My grandmother who is 87 had an injury to her nose as result of falling out of her wheelchair.  She did lose alot of blood due to blood thinner.  This accident ocurred 2 weeks ago.  She is doing better but her H&H levels are low 8.2 was 8.7 2 days ago and 25.2%   They want to send her for blood transfusions but I have read risks and not confident this is the way to go.  They are taking her blood daily and they took it this morning hence the lower levels and they started her back on coumedin therapy too.  Can her H&H levels be lower in the am?
output: Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Both reduced hemoglobin and reduced hematocrit indicates anemia.2. However, 8.2g% is not significant, unless she has associated co-morbidities like cardiac failure.3. If she has cardiac problems or any breathing difficulty, she will require packed red cell transfusion to avoid further complications. Daily blood Chat Doctor.  Continue all medications. She needs to be on blood thinner to avoid heart attack or stroke. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

input: Hello Doc, we are planning for the baby now and its been 4 months we are trying and we havent took any precautions so would like to know the percentage of conceiving? Secondly, i would like to know that how much it takes for the fluid to travel inside the girl as after intercourse i have seen that every time the fluid comes out so would like to know how the sperms remain inside and what is the normal timeframe also is there any position that i need to stay sometime after the intercourse so that the sperms flows?
output: Hiu can take up to one year to make ourself conceive.

input: Hi ! Am 29 had endo yrs Severe period pain every month I never much of a life whilest on my period cant work eat or do anything to help myself ,nothing worked , found out I had pulmonary Endometriosis had surgery on my lungs few months ago then 2 weeks ago I had a laparscopy treatment for my end and Fibroid cyst , been married for 5 yrs we really want to start a family now can I get pregnant?
output: HelloThanks for posting your query. When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not. If the doctor said that the tubes were patent(that is, not blocked), there is good chance of your getting pregnant. If your periods are regular, and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well. However, if you don't get pregnant in the next one year, do go back and see a gynecologist with interest in fertility. The doctor would order a few other tests and advice you if you would need help in getting pregnant like IVF. Best wishes.

input: my son who is 4 and about 38lbs. has been complaining of a stomach ache right around his navel and has thrown up several times( all liquid looking vomit). He has complained some about a headache and at one point it felt as though he had a slight fever though has been hard to tell his whole body has felt hot most of the day. When I gave him a bath to try and help him feel better he got out of the tub with teeth chattering and his whole body shaking like he was freezing but he felt warm to the touch! What is wrong with him. I have given him fever reducer.
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards - 

input: My brother-in-law aged 61 years old diagnosed with 2 blocks in the heart and also a block in right way of passage to kidney and advised for bypass surgery. He has the history of Hypertention, Diabetics for a decade also suffers from gastric ulcers. Some of our well wishers contemplating on going for KEELEYs method of treatment to avoid surgery. Can you please give details about this method and how far it is successful as an alternative to bypass surgery. Thank you very much. P. Srinivasulu / INDIA.
output: Hello thank you for posting here. I have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. Wishing you good health thank you

output: HelloRepeated cough and cold is more commonly occur due to viral infection or allergic disorder. But if it is due to bacterial infection(diagnosed after thorough clinical examination and investigation) immunodeficiency must be ruled out. If fever is not associated each time with other symptoms and there is positive family history of allergic disorder;it is more suggestive of allergic in origin.

He is scheduled to go back in two weeks. He has been dealing with a sore neck (stiff) since Tuesday. Doesn t remember pulling any muscles as they told him not to do any work for the two weeks.

input: My husband had a spinal cord injury in Sept. 2013 which left him paralyzed and unable to urinate on his own for one month. He is now walking with a cane and can urinate on his own but still not properly. He is on Flomax to help. He is also on water pills because his legs will swell up. An emg showed nerve damage. My question is his shins are very shiny and they occasionally blister or split open even when his legs do not look swollen. This is a great concern to me. Even though he does not work or walk around like he used to, he is certainly not sitting around all day like he was when he was first injured. Any ideas?

input: Hi! I just changed into my pajamas and noticed that I have many (somewhere around 15) small bruises on the insides and backs of my thighs. In the past few days, I have done nothing that might cause these. It s happened a few times in the past, but not often. A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer. Could the bruising be a result of my sore throat? Or should I be seeing a doctor?
output: Hi!welcome to Chat Doctor!SPONTANEOUS BRUISES point towards some bleeding disorder, coagulation defect or thrombocytopenia that is reduced platelet count. Certain viral infections that cause sore throat may also cause platelet to fall resulting in spontaneous bleeding. They are not related to cancer, but you must see a doctor get examined and tested for platelet count and coagulation profile. Hope this will help you!take care!

input: Hi, wondering whether or not you think its possible my pregnancy is still viable? Ive neever had any real symptoms other than going to the toilet more. My LMP was 22 October, I did my first pregnancy test on 26th December, strong positive, did another one one new years eve with a clearblue test and it said 1-2 weeks pregnant and said to add 2 weeks on for how doctor would date it. Did yet another test due to no symptoms on 14th January which said 3+ weeks and again to add 2 weeks for doctors dates. I paid for a private scan on the 21st January and they believed by the size it was only 5 weeks 3 days, 10days on and still no crmaping,no bleeding and no symptoms?
output: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October, your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had, but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis. However, it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates. So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. Furthermore, judging the number of weeks of pregnancy on a urine tests is extremely inaccurate. Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone Chat Doctor from that whicChatDoctores out in your urine. However, your urine can be diluted by different amounts of water depending upon what time in the day you tested and how much water you Chat Doctor.  Most urine pregnancy tests ask that you use your first morning urine, which has the most concentrated sample, however, even within those restrictions there is a large margin of error. So I would advise, in your situation, that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks. In the meantime take good care of yourself for the pregnancy by: eating a well-balanced diet,

Since October 2008 Ive been having breathing problems, cause i was working around chemicals and fumes! I wa put off work in June 2009 and forgot one important thing my gallbladder was removed in August 2009 with gallstones in it and the doctors thought at that time that my liver and kidney was damaged as well due to the fact of how bad my gallbladder was!

input: hello recently I have developed a rather sharp pain above my naval. I have looked into a bacterial infection and have been cleaning it with alcohol and to no success. the pain has traveled and hurts in a 3 inch diameter above my groin and to the right a tad. I have also looked into an umbilical hernia but I am a bit skeptical, and I am not sure it is appendicitis.
output: Hello, Appendicitis is a high probability. The pain in appendicitis begins in the per umbilical region(that is around the naval) and then migrates to an area called as McBirney point that is at the junction of the medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of a line joining your naval with the anterior superior William spine. This area is roughly the same as you have mentioned. Further evaluation is needed. Blood counts, urine examination and ultrasound scan of the abdomen are required. In appendicitis the blood counts will be high, urine will be normal or show mild hematuria and USG abdomen will show an elongated or enlarged appendix. Treatment is mainly surgical, however in some rare mild cases, medical management with painkillers and antibiotics may be tried.

input: What is he progression of mantle cell lymphoma? My 74 year old husband had only 2 treatments when the oncologist determined the treatment was not working...his platelets were 72 and his WBC was 358,000. They basically told him to go home and die. That was a month ago. He has become steadily weaker. He has an appetite, but cannot eat much at one sitting. He has edema in his feet. He is now complaining of a pain in his upper right quadrant; somewhere around his under arm and radiates to the back of his shoulder blades.We are totally clueless.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Mentle cell lymphoma is one of the most aggressive tumor known till day. It is resistant to chemotherapy and rapidly worsening in days only. In your husbands' case as he is having right sided back and chest pain, I think he is developing malignant effusion. So better to rule out this by chest x-ray. If effusion than pigtail catheter insertion will help him symptomatically. So get done chest x-ray and pigtail Chat Doctor.  Also discuss end of life issues with him. This will give him more support.

input: Hi my left bottom wisdom tooth is coming through and painful but also my lymph nodes are swallen and soar Im sure its perconitus but I also have like a large patch on my cheek which looks like what I can only describe as acny like on my left cheek. , is this normal and can it be treat without a dentist
output: Hiwelcome to ChatDoctorduring the eruption of wisdom tooth it sometime cause pain. If the tooth is infected then it may lead to enlarge lymph node.  First get your OPG X-ray runabout patch, if its white then depends on weather its cheek bite, leukoplakia or candidiasis etc. Which can also be confirmed by seeing the patch. For both thing visit dentist. Meanwhile for wisdom tooth do warm saline gargles and can get painkiller. Thank you

input: I have been having moderate headaches for quite some time - pain mainly in the back of the head - high on the left side. Is it worth an MRI? Pain meds seem to help but the pain often radiates to other parts of the head. I do have a swelling on the left side of my neck which my physician said was not serious.
output: Hi, I have gone through your medical history carefully and can say as following: You are saying to have moderate headaches, manly in the back of the head and high on the left side. Meanwhile, swelling on the left side of your neck is present. If I was your caring doctor would advise running X-ray of neck first to evaluate the swelling. Most probably spondyloarthrosis is suspected especially if such pain is subsided after taking pain medications, however, need further diagnostic tests to run. For the moment, I advise continuing taking pain medications and do not apply anything locally until the real nature of the swelling in the neck is totally elucidated. Hope it was of help!

input: A friend went to the emergency room this past Monday morning with severe flu-like symptoms. On Thursday, she was diagnosed with meningitis. On Friday afternoon, it was determined to be viral, and she was rereleased with instructions to stay home and rest for 1 week. Yesterday she was beginning to feel better, but is not feeling as well today as yesterday. Is this fall back today a normal part of the recovery process, or Is it a sign of a possible relapse? Should she perhaps be gotten back to the hospitals? Thanks for your time.
output: Hellos you mentioned that your friend is having meningitis (virus, causative organism) . Doctor discharged your patient from hospital because this is self limiting due to antigen antibodies (maybe the type of such virus, that's why patient discharged). So this tiredness is an in recovery phase, if fever is not present then , need not worry. So be careful, take care good nourished diet as well complete rest but remain contact with doctor.

input: Hello, my wife has been dealing with left leg pain and weakness for the past 15 years. Recently my wife developed left arm, face and tongue weakness and numbness. She was diagnosed with a 5mm Chiari malformation and was given steroids to relieve migraines. After seeing a neurosurgeon she was told she was ineligible for surgery and has been told that she may be making up the symptoms in her head. We don t believe that, basically her left leg, arm and now face experiences pain and weakness and we have no idea why. She was tested for MS but with no lesions and multiple side symptoms that was rules out. Any advice you can provide would be appreciated.
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor ! I read carefully your question and understand your concern. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a cervico-thoracic spine MRI study to exclude possible syringomyelia, which could cause her symptoms. This is a common complication of Chary Malformation. Anyway, it would not explain the numbness in her face or tongue. Another option would be starting an antidepressant, especially considering the fact they she suffered from migraines. These Chat Doctor.  Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes, 

input: have sevre anxiety, i cannot drive a car, i am on disability due to my emotional irreluulations and mild agoraphobia, my anxiety has recently started taking control of my body to the point where i have to lay on the ground and wait for all my muscles to sieze spasms, ive had 2 heartattack at the age of 18. and i feel like these are all sympotms of a bigger problem, i need help before its to late.
output: HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor I think, you have agoraphobia with panic attack. In that case, you need antidepressant with low dose benzodiazepine. You should consult a psychiatrist for proper management. You can also try some relaxation exercise like JPMR or deep breathing exercise. That would help to control the symptoms. In case, you need further help, you can ask. Thanks

input: What does this mean, Delayed planar images demonstrate mild uptake within the left L4-L5 region.SPECT -CT of the lumbar spine was obtained. This demonstrates no evidence of disc uptake however, there is very mild facet uptake at L4-L5 on the left. Hypertrophic facet degenerative changes seen in the region on nondiagnostic CT.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. The uptake seen at L4 - L5 with hypertrophic facet changes are indicative of degeneration because of aging. Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles. A pinched nerve can also arise from this condition. You must consult a neurologist and probably also get a lumbar spine MRI scan done to know if there is a disc herniation or nerve impingement which is not seen clearly on SPENT CT should you experience severe pain in the region. It is important to know why you got a spent CT done and if it is related to any cancerous condition for which you are taking treatment. There is no serious concern for the above findings.

I feel even if it was an accident why are we killing this baby, it was not its fault it was conceived and now i feel its my job to protect it but I am scared about just up and leaving, he has threatened that if i leave he will find me and take my baby that he does not want and raise it with his ex.  what should I do
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  The cause of your fear is due to conflict of opinion. That is normal. Also, you have a good human view point towards this issue. But you must also understand your husbands view. He could be compelling you to abort because of some compelling issues. Talk to him about this. Understand his feelings and points. Do not argue. Arguments always provides no result. Discuss. Discussions always produce results, decisions. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve in this region (also called neuralgia), or a bulging disc in the vertebral column, probably due to the trauma. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing a CT scan of the lumbosacral spine, coupled with a nerve conduction study. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Kind regards,

I am convinced, that THC can stop cancer , but in Germany this therapy is illegal. I am informed about studies in Rostock (Germany), Barcelona (Spain) and offcourse the Rick Simpson hempoil therapy. Te question is: Are there such therapys in India?

input: Hi..my baby is one month old...he cries a lot at night...sumtimes he s inconsolable...he s on breastfeed n top feed..we burp him regularly Aftr every Feed...still he cries a lot..we hav been suggested by our friends to give neopeptine as a mild dose n colicaid only if necessary ..wht do you suggest ...our doctor refused. Us fr any medicine.
output: Hi.... Your doctor is 100% right. I, too, do not suggest any medicine. I will give an explanation why so... This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there. Next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Regards - 

input: Hi, one of the bumps right at the back of my tongue (lingual tonsil area) is a yellowy  colour, not pink like the rest.i was looking because i have a bug at the moment and a congested throat/nose...now i am manically googling tumors! Any idea what it could be?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. In tongue there are naturally larger taste buds at the back of tongue as compared to front. Also, there is lingual papillae As you mentioned you have an infection, chances are it could be an enlarged taste bud or papillae due to infection, medication or some allergy. It can also be an ulcer. Normally This happens with fever and infection and regress on their own. I suggest you to check if it is discolored, enlarge or have uneven borders, then get it checked. Else you can wait for healing up of your infection. Take your prescribed medications. Take multivitamin tablet one per day. Maintain God oral hygiene. If warm water is tolerated, do warm saline rinses. Maintain good diet and HY Chat Doctor.  If it burns while eating, you can apply oral anesthetic gel 5 min before eating. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!

input: I feel fine in the morning and all day but for the last two days I have been getting very dizzy at the end of the day, around 4:30 to 5:00 and a little lightheaded. I havent changed any eating patterns or anyhing, what is the most common cause for random dizziness?
output: Hello, If this is only a symptom that has been happening for the past 2 days I would recommend you increase your fluid intake for the next several days using pure and fresh WATER.  I would cut out caffeine and caffeinated beverages.  Make sure you've been getting plenty of rest and I believe you should start feeling better.  You say you haven't changed your eating patterns but do you eat your meals on time or do you skip depending on the need at school or at work?  Otherwise, if your symptoms are not self-limited over the next day or 2 you may wish to schedule an appointment with your doctor for an examination and some laboratory analyses to check on things such as electrolyte disturbances, blood counts that may point to anemia or infection, etc. Hope I have answered your query.

input: I have had severe lower back pain around L-5 on my left side. I have been on meds 400 ml ibuprofin for approx. 1 year, now the pain has traveled down my left leg and I have had to increase the meds as needed. Aprox. 5 years ago i fell down a small flight of stairs with approx. 25 lbs in hand. I struck the last step on the right side of my buttox which caused an enormous contusion superficially. However, I have had lasting pain in the area but no one has been able to identify the source. I believe that the injury on the right side has eventually caused the continuous pain on the left
output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Pain traveling down your leg and increasing in intensity means advancing of disease. In this case most probably there is herniated disc disease, so I suggest you to consult a Neurologist and to discuss the possibility of imaging study of your lumbar spine. Since there has been trauma you'll need plain radiographs and MRI imaging. Treatment modalities should become clear after this. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

input: My lower right abdomen hurts almost like a pulled muscle but increases with a deep breathe. I dont remember doing anything to aggrevate it but maybe I did. I have had my appendix taken out years ago but maybe diverticulitis? I was told I had it years ago but never had an attack.

Anyway the pain in lower abdomen as you have described looks to have underlying pathology. Get investigated fast. Start on antibiotics, soft bland diet, preferably more of a liquid diet.

input: Hi... I have a high ankle break & my doctor has me wearing a walking boot cast. I am to wear the cast 23 hours a day & can take it off for an hour for bathing purposes. I m now experiencing cramps in my calf muscle while wearing the cast/boot. Any solutionsfor alleviating the cramps?
output: Hello, As these cramps are due to muscle non-moving and due to the muscles having disturbed transmission of the sodium from its channels. As and when you get a cramp having a pinch of salt will be good to avoid the cramps. Also, simple toe movements will help the muscle physiology to be intact. Hope I have answered your query.

input: I ve had (3x in 3 months) itchy, swollen weltish skin outbreaks that appear over several days on my upper arms and neck, and take several days to resolve. They are red like a bug bite in a way, but lack the raised, 1/2 - 1 cm distinct bite area. They develop a corona about 3 cm in diameter, so my body is clearly having an immune response to whatever this is. PA examined today at my Derm s and ruled out bed buts, scabies, prescribed topical steroids. I have no known allergies, at 59 enjoy good health! HOWEVER it has dawned on me today, I have had no trouble with them but do have silicone breast implants that were installed in 1997. YIKES. Get a mammo every July so one coming up, last one both sonogram plus xray and no leaks detected. I am wondering if some failure of the implants is leaking wierd chemicals into my body and that is the foundational issue. How can I check out whether this is the problem causing my inflammatory skin response? Yikes. again.
output: Hellodont worry. This is nothing but impurities of blood.u need Ayurveda treatment from a good expert. For now take tab.hard Chat Doctor. For more u can contact me again

input: I have been very anxious the last couple days and my heart rate has been high. It has been over 130bpm at some points and then as low as 80 when I am relaxed. I have panic attacks but usually my heart rate does not get that high. Could his be dangerous?
output: ! I have read your question carefully and from that I can say from my clinical experience that the heart rate increases due to stress. However, as you are very concerned, it will help you to get an ECG done, and blood pressure checked. Once these turn to be normal, I think you must meet a psychiatrist and get a detailed evaluation done. Only After listening yo your problem and your current status one can decide the line of management. I have seen that such ceases respond greatly to paroxetine in a dose of 12.5 to 37.5 mg daily.  The doctor may ask you for therapy, which I think will give additional benefit and help you control some part of anxiety and stress. Hope the reply is helpful feel free to ask more questions Chat Doctor. 

input: Hey recently these thoughts have been coming into my head and it all started with thinking how happy i am in my relationship with my fiance and how i have never felt so happy. In work there is a guy who i went with years ago and then these thoughts started coming into my head what if such or whatever were to happen and i started to freak out because i was thinking to myself what the hell am i thinking. Then my head started going through all the men in my past life and it is killing me. ITS Like my mind automatically thinks of them without me knowing and it depresses the hell out of me and it is damaging and hurting me soo much that i can barely concentrate on my happy times now because i feel so negative all the time? I know myself that i would never never act on my thoughts but i just want my brain to return to normality. What can i do? Please
output: Hello, i would advise you to meet a psychiatrist immediately to rule out other diagnosis so that it would be easy to put you on to a right medication once they confirm the diagnosis. Do not ignore your symptoms and if they persist consult your physician immediately.I hope I have answered your query. Take care

input: Hi, I pregnancy tested yesterday three times and twice I got a faint positive result although one vanished after a few hours, the other is still clearly there. Today my doctor ran a test and it was negative after two minutes but positive when I was leaving. She wants to wait a week but I want to know is it possible for two positive faint lines when I am not pregnant? I have run another two today and both say no....Thanks
output: Hi, I think you should do a blood test for pregnancy bChatDoctor.  It will confirm the pregnancy.  An ultrasound can also be done to clear the doubt.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: hi,,,,,i am 32 years old woman....trying to conceive from last 1 year.....got the follicular study done couple of times and was found ok....now my doc has referred me for iui....please let me know what could be the reason for not conceiving after every thing being normal.... my hsg test was also normal..
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns. Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be worried. You will conceive. Since your doctor has already started treatment I presume that all baseline infertility investigations including semen analysis are normal. Then this is called as unexplained infertility. The cause cannot be found with available investigations. What your doctor has done is right step. Have GUI after induction of ovulation with Gonadotrophin. You can have 3-4 cycles of GUI. I hope and pray you conceive with the help of GUI. If you do not get pregnant with this treatment, the next option would be IVF (in vitro fertilization). I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through Chat Doctor. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. I hope this is helpful. If you have any further concerns do contact me through Chat Doctor.

input: I have pain in my left arm,feels like muscle when I rotate my arm to the right and lift up its sharp. Shoveling snow today didn t help and now its a steady throb. not sure if a xray will help or if I m going to have to have a mri . it s been going on for at least a month or longer.
output: hello must attend an orthopedic clinic for proper examination and investigations.it could be supraspinatus tendinitis or biceps tendinitis (inflammation of tendons which attach muscle to bone) or even shoulder joint problem. Do hot fomentation and take Advil tabs after meals thrice a day and rest arm in a broad shoulder-arm sling till you attend orthopedics clinic. A weeks rest to 10 days would be good in sling along with medicines. The final treatment can be decided after examination and X-rays if necessary, MRI, if needed only thanks

input: My mother in law is in remission from limited stage small cell lung cancer and she wants a partial hip replacement. Her doctors gave her clearance for the surgery but I m afraid she won t heal well. will this surgery possibly cause her to relapse with cancer due to stress on her body?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry about relapse. Partial hip replacement is done under spinal anesthesia and stress level and risk both are less than general anesthesia. And doctors have declared her fit for surgery means she is able to cope up with the surgical stress. So no need to worry about relapse. Get done surgery. And continue her chemotherapy cycles as per schedule.

input: I m looking at the effects of low blood pressure starting the day 97/61 with a heart beat of 64. Movement to cerebral biofeed through oxygenated hike in the trails of autumn under rainy and 10 degrees conditions. What I find consistent is; only after a sweated workout do I sense the pathological pain pressures of the left parietal quadrant; that quadrant is completely separated and pain in persistent. The reason for the workout is for picking up the chi energy of the 4 oclock cycle.
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that low blood pressure can be associated to different symptoms: - pressure headache-blurring vision-shortness of breath-ear noise-fainting and loss of conscience. It is quite normal to experience low blood pressure after a lot of physical activity. It may be related to sweating and deny Chat Doctor.  Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, 

input: Dear Dr Candan. I would like to ask you you how you read the following values for my semen? How is the potential for using these values of semen to make an egg pregnant : Volume 1.5 Sperm concentration (mill/mL) 38 Rapid linear progressive (A) 00,0 Slow/ Non-linear progressive (B) 09,0 Non-progressive 08,0 Non-motile 83,0
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor The analysis for your semen is as follows:Volume is 1.5 ml/ ejaculate-This is low volume as the normal volume per ejaculate should be at least 2 sperm count is 38 million/ml- This is normal sperm counts. The cut-off for normal sperm count is at least 20 million/ sperm motility is less than the normal range. Non-motile sperms are 83 %. Normally at least 50 % sperms should have rapid progressive forward motion. There is no comment on morphology and presence/ absence of pus cells, RBC's and other nucleated cells. On the basis of this report your sample is deficient in adequate volume and adequate volume. It can lead to infertility i.e. inability to fertilize an egg under physiological conditions. However, I recommend you to get semen analysis repeated after three days of abstinence. If, again the sperm count remains low, there are other techniques for fertilization of the ovum. You can get details of which from a fertility expert. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi, my father is 90 years old. He has just taken his blood pressure and has a reading of 209/63. He had a lie down and it has dropped back to about 190. What should I do when it goes up so high? He is on medication for it, is there anything else that would bring it down quickly or should he go to a Doctor or hospital?

input: Had blood tests and ultrasound done for abd pain - found nothing. Have now got it into my head that I have hodgins disease because i am also slightly itchy
output: Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor, You are presuming a big ailment for no obvious reason at all. The common symptoms of Hodgkin's disease are generalized lymph node enlargement, may be weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly. It has to be proved by special tests like immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples. Itching is totally unrelated to this. If you had homeostasis causing itching, it would have been detected by ultrasound. It would be helpful to have a gastroenterologist work up with endoscopy if the pain is too much and tests like those for typhoid etc. Take care.

input: dear sir/mam, i had my last period on 28th dec 2010, till now i didnt get periods, i undergone pregnancy test its negative, so my dr referred me take meprate 10 mg now i m takiing , last two days i m getting guiltiness and i felt may be am i pregnancy?
output: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion giddiness alone might not suggest pregnancy. The pregnancy symptoms like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts, giddiness,tiredness might be there with positive urine pregnancy test. Meprate tablets are given for with Chat Doctor. Also, the pregnancy test is negative. The giddiness might be due to weakness.Don't worry. Take healthy nutritional diet. If irregular periods continue get evaluated for thyroid abnormalities, PCOD. Avoid stress. Stress, overweight, obesity might also cause irregular periods. So relax. Best regards....

input: I had a severe allergic reaction to an ant bite about a week and a half ago. Blood pressure dropped to 70/63 and was rushed to the ER and was given loads of Benadryl, went through 2 bags of fluid and had to be put on oxygen. I m still very tired though, I have this running exhaustion feeling. My question is- how long is this supposed to last? Is it normal for me to be feeling so tired?
output: Hi, see allergic reaction can be immediate, late and/or delayed from which the later can be last for more than 2 days, so u might have delayed hypersensitivity/Allergic reaction due to ant bite. If this problem remains even after few weeks and u still feel exhaustion or tired then there will be some other cause.u need to see your physician for correct diagnosis but don't worry nothing serious, u will be alright.

output: Dear Friend. Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I have read your query in detail, I understand your concern. I feel that requires evaluation, that swelling can arise from bone, or it can be soft tissue swelling.

input: My four-year-old vomits very easily. This morning he ate food he eats all the time -- pancakes, grapes, milk -- was perfectly fine, threw up, was perfectly fine again. This happens every now and again. Is it a weak gag reflex? Could it be more serious stomach issues?

They are fairley small but kind of hard. Is wetting the bed a sign of testicular cancer? do you think it should be checked out? or is there any other possiblity it could be?

For that I suggest investigating with ultrasonography of testes first for primary work up according to that report further management decided. Kindly upload photo of lesion to comment further Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: Hi, my daughter has super ventricular Tachycarida. She gets really short of breath when just taking the stairs at school so she used to use an elevator key, but the school took it away. Is there anything that she can do to help her breathing at school and at home?
output: Hello, Usually supraventricular tachycardia is usually episodic in nature and will not cause persistent shortness of breath.  First thing is that, the type of supraventricular tachycardia should be determined. So get one ECG done and upload it or show it to local doctor. If she is having persistent type of supraventricular tachycardia like atrial fibrillation then only it can cause this type of symptoms. For this rate control Chat Doctor.  Secondly we need to find for another cause, for that she'll need echo, hemoglobin testing.  In general, she should have salt and fluid including water tea milk coffee etc. restriction to minimum. Very good medicine are available so you either upload her reports or visit local doctor. She'll medicine like metoprolol, horsehide etc.

Suggestions: I have already told you how would I approach this issue, it needs proper check-ups and follow up to be controlled and treated well, for the time being if I were your doctor I would suggest you take an antihistamine for example loratadine 10 mg daily and an over the counter Painkiller+anti-inflammatory like Tylenol(acetaminophen) 325 mg thrice daily, But this is just to buy time till you can have a good contact with your doctor and all you reports are compiled and diagnosis is made...some people also need steroid to suppress allergy.CONCLUSION: Don't be alarmed there are doctors and clinics specialized in Allergy and it's a daily routine matter for them just follow this issue well and soon as you get settled on a med ...just one or two pills a day, and you will live a long healthy comfortable life ..... Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help if not then don't forget to close the discussion and rate it. Wishing you good health !!

input: Hi how are you doing? I have a question about my health, I just went to a doctor this afternoon and he found out that I have a h pilori desease, just wondering it can be detect where I might get this? My employer has this kind of desease, is it possible that she gave this to me?
output: Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorH. Pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium present in the stomach of persons. It is commonly transmitted person-to-person by saliva. It can also be spread by fecal contamination of food or water. Crowded conditions and poor hygiene contributes to higher H. pylori prevalence. H. pylori enters the body through the mouth, moves through the digestive system, and infects the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. More than 80% of people will be asymptomatic. But infected individuals are prone to get peptic disease. Hope you are happy with the answer. Thank you

input: Every day at work I drink tea in the morning with Splenda, and everyday my hands swell to the point that I cant remove my rings.  Ive tried different combinations of caffeinated and non-caffeinated teas, and different or no sweetners to try to figure out what can be causing the swelling and nothing has helped.  My only other thought is that it could be the filter in the line leading up to the pot.  The filter is an Everpure IN-10, and when I look at the spec I notice that Hexametaphosphate crystals are used in this filter.  Could this be causing the problem.  By the way, I do have high bloodpressure and take a medication which contains 12.5mg of HCTZ and an additional 25mg of HCTZ each day.

input: my 2 1/2 year old has been on cefzin for 3 days being treated for tonsillitiis. the last day and a half she has been very grumpy, like she doesnt feel good. is there a possibility she could still get strep like her sister had, even while she is on antibiotic?

input: Hi! I injured my knee at a football game 2 days ago, mechanism of injury=I kept falling on my knees,high impact. No instant swelling that I noted (adrenalin) but did feel pain, I admit I kept playing so did weightbear after falls..first fall of significance in first half. Knee started to stiffen up and get more painful towards end of match, knee noticeably swelling and real discomfort on car home and painful to sleep, ache walking and stairs or kneeling painful...used price technique straight away..iced it straight away, tubrigrip compression and elevated..knee now feels better..widespread bruising tender on palpation of joint line/bruises, knee not as stiff but still an ache at end range flexion swelling has reduced. I think when the bruising goes the dull ache in my knee should go too, I feel I dont need physio or medical intervention as its only been 3 days since injury and to let healing process take its course? Am I foolish or should I check if ligaments/cartilage isnt Injured even though the symptoms/mechanism don t match? Thanks
output: Hello, I have studied your case. As per your history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.

input: Doctor, afterstudying about BP, it is a chronic disorder of our blood flow inside our blood vessels, i believe it generally happens due to many of these elelments viz., 1. high mind pressure with internal tension 2. foods with high sodium levels 3. excess BMI with high cholesterol levels. - I am i right or wrong

input: I m a type 2 diabetic. My doctor changed my meds to three pills 5 months ago, Metformin gave extreme gastro side effects. So I have been taking Januvia, Glimeperide and Glipezide. It kept my blood sugar much lower but not perfect. I had 3 episodes of symptoms of low blood sugar but I never got a reading lower than 80. Now my pharmacists has questioned the 3 medication so, as of 3 weeks ago I no longer take Glimeperide. Now I m having mild pressure in my abdomen and sternem, shallow breathing and muscle tension for no reason. Any thoughts?
output: Hi sir. Usually diabetic medicines with metformin may cause abdominal problems like gastritis, ulcer.make sure that your sugar level is under control especially HE a1c is under control. Pain in lower abdomen and sternum is exactly due to gastritis so it's better to take anti ulcer medicines to solve this problem avoid taking oily and spicy foods avoid taking tea coffee or milk avoid some vegetables like radish cabbage and cauliflower so that it may help to reduce gastritis. Consult a physician for medications, thank you.

input: i have a rash on the inside of my bicep and it just so happens it is over the area where i had my implanon implanted. i had it implanted 8 months ago and am just now getting the rash and it looks a lot like the pupps rash i had on my stomach when i was pregnant. i don t know if it is related but i figured i would add that in.
output: Hello.thanks for sharing your query Since it is already 8 months since the insertion was done, I won't think that the Implant should be a cause of the rashes you have. You may apply a mild topical steroid for 3-4 days to see if it improves. If you have itching, oral anti histamines may be taken. However, if your lesions persist, you must visit a dermatologist.PUPPY rash is a pregnancy related condition and resolves mostly within a week of delivery. A few women continue to experience symptoms into the postpartum period, but I think this not be related to the present symptoms. Hope this is helpful. Take care.

input: This question concerns my mother in law: She is a 71 year old woman, and she is a smoker. 2 years ago, she had breast cancer , but it was cured through radiation therapy. This February she was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. She has been following chemotherapy treatment since April to October. The liquid in the bile duct has reduced, but there are still lesions on the liver, it is inflamed, and there are now lesions on the spleen . The oncologist said that a resection was out of the question, so he is trying a new drug combo of Irinotecan 180mg, Folinique Acid 400mg and Fluorouracil 400mg and 46 hours of Fluorouracil 2400mg followed by a week of rest. During all of the previous treatment, she has had very low haemoglobin and platelets. My husband and I would like to know a rough estimate as to the prognosis, as our oncologist seems to go back and forth with his answers
output: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. Cholangiocarcinoma does not have a very good prognosis per se. Even after complete chemotherapy, complete remission is difficult. The prognosis depends mainly on the stage of cancer. Anemia and thrombocytopenia is a side effect of chemotherapy. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

input: I am 18 years old. I got my period on October 15th and had unprotected sex on October 27th. On October 28th I took plan b. I am on birth control but took it at different times (within a few hours) the few days leading up to October 27th. (8 pm one day, 11:30 pm the next day, and 10 pm the next day) so I was very nervous and took the pill especially because it was around the time Im supposed to be ovulating. Then, I had unprotected sex on November 1st really late at night and the day before that I took my birth control 3 hours later than I normally do. Does plan b push back ovulation so I would be ovulating on the weekend of Nov 1st? Do you think that I have a chance of becoming pregnant??
output: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Contraceptive pills need to be taken regularly at fixed time. As you have taken pill daily but at irregular time, still It's effective in controlling ovulation. Not to worry. If at all you miss your periods get pregnancy test done. Try to take pill at a regular time daily, If you find it difficult to take regularly better to go for other methods of contraception. Hope this helps regards

input: I had sex with my gf last night, I had no groin pain and my sperm looked normal, today we had intercourse again and my right side above my penis near my bladder hurts and my right testical, also my sperm was dark yellow. What could this be? Please help.
output: Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor forum Pain might have occurred due to muscle pull/stretch during the intercourse/ blunt injury unknowingly during the act.  So, Muscle relaxant with a painkiller will help you a lot.  Regarding your color of semen, it sometimes varies normally & during infection. So, please for semen analysis if you have any doubts or any symptoms like burning sensation/frequency/pain while urinating.  All the best.

input: Hi, I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease since about age 15, I am now 48 years old. My lumbar all the way down through sacral has been fused. I have constant pain in right foot/toes that I have been able to control for about 7 to 8 years, but now pain is getting worse in back above fusion and in the front below belly button. I am wondering if I may now have an issue at T-12 ? I am a male if that makes any difference.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. You require to be examined a neurologist and an MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. If the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. Please do not worry.

The lump behind the ear usually due to an enlarged lymph node. Consult the doctor if the swelling is increasing. Hope I have answered your query. Regards.

output: Dear user, welcome to Chat Doctor. With a very low sperm count the only way to get pregnant is through intro cytoplasmic sperm injection (CSI). You should try another time with the maximum dose of HMG (450 IU) or try the short antagonist protocol. If you are obese try to optimize your body mass index (BMI). I can help you more if you mention your age, BMI, day 2 FSH and LH, prolactin, TSH and antimullerian hormone (AMH). I wish you good luck and getting pregnant soon.

input: my boyfriends semen is normal looking but has chunky pieces in it jello-like in texture and they stay jello-like they dont melt or anything i know he used to do a lot of drugs before we started dating is it just side effects from smoking crack? (hes been clean for a year and half now) or is it infertility? does he have an STD? cause before we started dating i made him get checked out considering his past and he turned up clean on the tests. he says that his semen has had chunks in it for quite awhile but it kinda conserns me like i dont want to catch anything and i do want to have a child someday
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. These symptoms and signs are suggestive of STD especially if there is associated pain, fever, urethral discharge and recent sexual intercourse. So this is the first thing to rule out by doing STD testing. Second, it may be signed of reinfection o urinary stones and some other genital infection, but this is less common. In every case, antibiotic therapy may be required, so test should be done as soon as possible so that appropriate treatment can be started. Till that try to Chat Doctor. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.

input: Can i nebulize my child 5 year old with clenil compositum and atem together?? I used to nebulize him with simple clenil compositum and normal saline every winter season .. but now his coughing is not going.. he recently started penecillin day before yesterday because his chest infection was not going
output: Hello, Short answer: Detailed answer: You can use clinic composite together with item. Scientific studies show that when clinic composite (containing albuterol) is given together with item (containing ipratropium bromide), the results are better compared to clinic composite alone. Therefore, you can give both preparations together, 2-4 times a day because they will not harm your baby but at the contrary, will help him. Also, you should find a solution for the chest infection, by changing the type of antibiotic for example, in close contact with your doctor, because it is a cause of your babies cough. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: My mother is diabetic, has a mitral valve which needs replaced buy she is not healthy enough for the replacement. She has a pacemaker which she, per examine, is working 89% of the time. For the last three weeks she has been dizzy, very weak and has short term memory loss. Her primary care doctor says to let her be. Am I over reacting
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I passed carefully through your question and would explain that her symptoms could be related to low blood flow to the brain. A stroke or a metabolic disorder can not be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with her attending doctor for a careful physical exam. Some tests are needed to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a brain CT scan-complete blood count for anemia-fasting glucose and HbA1C levels-blood electrolytes- kidney and liver function tests. Meanwhile, I would recommend you to closely monitor her blood pressure values to exclude possible low blood pressure. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health, 

input: I have been dealing with kidney stones since 1979. Recently I was in the emergency for pain from a kidney stone blockage. The ER doc ordered a CT scan to confirm the stone. When the results came back he informed me that I had stones in my liver and my spleen . My questions are: What causes spleen and liver stones; and is any treatment advised?
output: Hi Linda, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Since you have stones in the kidney, liver and spleen, you will need to do thyroid function tests to rule out hypercalcinosis, which is a condition in which there is above normal levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to stone formation in various organs. If hypercalcinosis is detected, then it will need to be treated. Liver and spleen stones don't need to be treated. If there are stones in the Gall Bladder and if they are causing problem, then surgical removal of gall bladder is required.  Wish you all the best.

input: hi doc, im 34 male , and my semen analysis report says vol-4.9ml, colour-yellowish grey, transparency-opaque, consistency-watery, motility 50%active and progressive, 10% sluggish. pus cells 4-6/, count 15million.what are my chances, what does this mean, thank you.
output: Hi! Your sperm count is a little less than the minimum normal and your sperm activity(motility) too falls a little short of the minimum required. This condition is called oligoasthenozoospermia. Several conditions like varicocele, partial sperm tube blockage, genital infection etc. may cause it. Please do not worry. Meet your urologist who should be able to sort it out. All the best!

input: sir,i was effected abdomen TB last Two years , I complete course and last one years i feel ok not any problem and no medician. Now i feel that my abdomen are large size and tight after food but i have no any symtom like no fever, no pain, no lose wts. I dought for again abdomen TB.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood the problem. It is good that you had been diagnosed and well treated for Tuberculosis of abdomen. Since you were asymptomatic for last year the chances of an active TB of abdomen is remote. The probable causes for belatedness and tightness of your abdomen can be: Intestinal sub-acute intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation of intestine; this is quite common sequel. Can be a mild gastroenteritis. I would advise you the following. X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm. Routine tests of blood and urine. Enterocolitis if obstruction is suspected, Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis and well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions. Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole for 5 days, is there is a response, nothing to worry. - Maintain healthy food habits, avoid too many fibrous foods as they can cause repeated sub-acute intestinal obstructions. If no relief further investigations and treatment will be required.

output: Hi, I think you should take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The problem in PCs is with ovulation. So, you have to take medicines for ovulation.  Bigoted alone will not help.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: I have a friend that has MS and has to take shots. He took a shot and there was a lot of blood that followed after he took the needle out. I was thinking his blood was too thin.  (I take warfarine and this is why I was concerned) He drinks a lot of Red Bulls drinks too.
output: Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You are taking warfarin.  It is oral anticoagulant Chat Doctor.  It prevents clotting of blood.  So it leads to bleeding.  You should test your PT and INR. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

input: On Friday I started getting the chills and noticed I had a fever of 102+. I took Theraflu thinking it was a flu coming on. However, I kept getting a fever every few hours. On Saturday, I started getting watery diarrhea. Later that night, my fever spiked to 103.3. I still have diarrhea and have to use the bathroom every 2-3 hours. I took a tylenol last night and the fever has not come back yet. However, I still have to keep using the bathroom and it does not seem to be getting better. Is there anything I can do to stop this?
output: I warmly Welcome you! Thanks for consulting me at virtual clinic. I have carefully worked through your case, and I can realize your health worries. Being your physician, I assure you not to worry as I will take care all of your medical concerns. I usually prescribe in such cases Rifaximin (Ibadan) 200 mg per oral 8 hourly for 5 days. Use Mediate for revitalization and fulfil the fluid and electrolyte losses. It seems to be due to gastroenteritis due to some unhygienic/raw food. Only Tylenol can not be effective. You may need to go to your Physician for prescription of antibiotics. Hope it helped you today.

input: My baby is of two weeks. First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly?
output: Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any.

input: Hi, I am a 34 year old women, I got sick in December just before Christmas. I went to the doctor 4 times. He told me that I had bronchitus and gave me meds. The cough got better and o did my chest, but I have had a heavy feeling in my chest for about a month now. When I lie down it feels like I have a lump in my Throat. I dont smoke, never have and am not overweight. Can I have Lung cancer? I am really worried
output: Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor if you are experiencing symptoms. The possibilities based from just your description are varied. Most common causes of lung cancer are history of smoking, occupational exposure to chemicals or inhalation agents that could be deposited in lungs, hereditary. Diagnostic studies such as chest x-ray, ct-scan of neck and chest area could easily rule-out if you have lesions. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.

Stomach cramps etc. I am afraid of side effects of meds like tolerance after a whole and other issues. I am now quite tired of dealing with this condition naturally. What help can you suggest.
output: Hi, I can understand your concern about side effects after using Zoloft (Sertraline). Loose motions, stomach cramps, headache, abdominal discomfort, sleep disturbance are common side effects in initial weeks of treatment with Sertraline.

input: I break out after taking a shower, sweating, and swimming. Hi. i recently went to the beach and jumped into the ocean, swimming for 45 mins. when i got out and dried off, i broke out into a rash with small bumps and red patches around them. I went in the water the next day, same thing. after that, I started digging a hole in the sand. i sweated a lot, and the same thing happened. It happens whenever i take a shower now too. i came back from the beach and every night when i take a shower i break out into this really itchy rash, like a form of hives! I tried taking a cold shower, not using shampoo or soap, switching soap/shampoo, patting myself dry, and using moisturizing lotion after i dry off and nothing has worked, i always break out. what is wrong with me!? This is really frustrating.
output: Hello this is an allergic reaction may be from ocean water, so you can use anti-allergic medicine orally and lactocalamine lotion for application.

My qustion is, If I choose not to take this medication what are my chances of recurrence and would it be ok if I choose not to?
output: Hayes with Chat Doctor.  Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen. Anastrozole decreases the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers. Hot flashes, headache, trouble sleeping, dizziness, stomach upset, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain, tiredness/weakness, increased coughing, or sore throat may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: heart disease (such as history of heart attack), bone loss (osteoporosis), liver disease, high blood pressure, blood clots. I will advise you to take one anastrozole tablet per day for 5 years. Its side effects can be managed symptomatically, Regards

input: I have been extremely fatigued lately and cannot figure out why. After sleeping 14-15 hours last night, and only being awake for the past 6, I m ready to go to bed already, it is only 7:30pm, and I slept this morning until 1:30pm. I have been very busy lately, I am not anemic and my thyroid is normal. I am on depression medication sertraline and my white blood cell count is off- my doc says I could be still recovering from an illness such as mono, but I am unsure of what could be causing this extreme tiredness. It s preventing me from daily activities.
output: HIT hanks for using Chat Doctor Physical tiredness occur due to multiple reason, but I think in you case, chances of depression is more. Maybe you need a little higher dose of antidepressant to improve the symptoms. You can try few stimulants like modafinil or Ardabil, that would keep you active.

input: My 1 year old has been having 6 to 8 bowel movements a day for almost 2 weeks and has horrible diaper rash. She was treated successfully for thrush a few months ago, but I don t see any obvious white spots in her mouth. Plus, I don t recall her having frequent BMs the last time.
output: Hello, Your baby having loose stools for 14 days along with diaper rashes is suggestive of lactose intolerance. It is seen in babies that have some infection in their gut due to difficulty in digesting lactose and sugar in milk; this makes them pass stool with acidic pH which leads to diaper rashes. Apply Silver Mini cream or any zinc oxide cream on the affected area after cleaning the area, each time after passing stool. Get a stool examination for pH levels done; reduce and change milk to a low lactose formula. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: hi, i have come of the contraception pill 3 months ago and have not had a period since, i have got contant pains as if im about to start my period but nothing happens. i have extremely tender breasts, discharge, lower back pains and abdoman pains, however i have took test after test and all say negative. i need some advice please
output: Dear patient It may take months for normal menses to start after stopping contraceptive pills. Also, all symptoms suggest of normal menstrual period, but you are not getting menses so there might be retention of menses inside uterus. I would advise ultrasound of abdomen to look for uterus and its endometrium.  Please take visit to gynecologist and get yourself examined.  All the best.

input: I have high blood pressure and I was told that my potassium level was low so I bought some potassium gluconate pills today they are 595 mg and I am scared to take them after reading about the side effects. What should I do I have an appt. to see a cardioligist next monday?
output: Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your clinical history and query, my opinion is as follows:1. Low potassium can increase blood pressure, however, it is usually not the sole reason. You need to be on antihypertensives with consultation from your doctor.2. Taking potassium tablets is risky. Cardiovascular effects, particularly arrhythmia are dangerous. 3. You can concentrate on improving potassium by improving diet by including items like banana, green leafy vegetables, potatoes, fish, yogurt, mushrooms, etc. Improving potassium will reduce risk of high blood pressure, stroke and cardiovascular disease. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

output: Hello, Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion. The efficacy rate of an emergency contraceptive pill depends on the time delay after the intercourse before the pill is used. When the pill is used soon after, the protection offered is 98-99 % while it decreases as time goes by. At 60 hours, the protection offered is around 80-85 %. Corvette is shown to have the same efficacy as any conventional emergency contraceptive pill. Please contact your health care provider for further help. Hope this helps.

output: Thanks for query. It is possible to get ribs fractured, but it is rare. Left chest pain can be due to pleural inflammation, angina, musculoskeletal, gastric ulcers etc. I think you must get a chest X-ray done and an ECG done. Meanwhile, can take antibiotic and analgesic. Best wishes

input: Hi, I m trying to conceive and I have been taking ovulation tests and last week I got a positive (smiley face) ovulation test, then negative the next day, then positive the day after that, and today (1 week later) I got a positive again! what does that mean? why could that be hapenning?
output: Hallow Dear, This dilemma seems to be either due to error in the kits or personal error. Delayed positive test could be due to exceptional additional delayed ovulation from the other ovary. In such confusion, I would advise you to take the help of ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic ovulation monitoring has an edge over the kit:1. It gives visual evidence of ovulation.2. It informs us about the size of the follicle when it ruptured to release egg. Follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size give best results of pregnancy. 3. It informs about the endometrial thickness also. For successful implantation, at least 10 mm thick endometrium is lucrative. I hope this helps you.

input: Family memeber, 85 and living alone, stopped her dialysis; did not have it on scheduled Saturday, talked to her son, Monday evening, then was found she had died in bed later that evening. Blood appeared in and around her mouth. Could you tell me why the blood? I understand she went peacefully.
output: Sorry to hear about the demise. In patients undergoing dialysis and having stopped there could be multiple reasons for bleeding. These patients have bleeding tendencies, so she might have bled from any ulcer in stomach or esophagus. Or if due to stopping of the dialysis, she might have developed pulmonary hypertension due to accumulation of excessive fluids in lungs and cause bleeding through lungs which might have surfaced during excessive bought of cough containing blood. These could be the main reasons that I think of from what you have told me in your question. Thank you

input: I am a 49 year old female who has been struggling with chronic, extreme fatigue, joint pain, chronic sinus infections, asthma and hives for about 18 months. My eosinophil levels are running about 1600-2000 unless I am on steroids. My IGE levels are also very high. I have had every allergy test imaginable but all are negative. I had sinus surgery a few months ago and felt better as long as I was on the steroids but as soon as I tapered off, all symptoms returned and I am feeling terrible again. Allergist ordered lots of blood tests including some checking for specific mutations but all are normal except the eosinophils and IGEs. He wants to do a bone marrow biopsy, which I have scheduled but am looking for any help on what this could be. Unless I am on steroids, I feel terrible and asthma is hard to control but once I am on them, I feel normail again and the asthma is completely under control
output: It seems you have to continue steroids as there is severe steroid dependent allergy/asthma.you may undergo further tests as advised for more definitive solution

input: I feel I am suffering from a potential anxiety disorder/ADHD. Ive always had panic attacks and the feeling of doom/fear over irrational things, but my problem seems to have gotten worse over the past few months. I find myself experiencing unexplained fear in completely banal places such as travelling on a bus or simply sitting in a lecture. I have also been experiencing nocturnal enuresis (something which I suffered from as a youngster) which surely cannot be helping with the anxiety as it is highly embarrasing! Could you possibly give me some advice?
output: Diagnosis: acute panic attacks with phobia social.treatment:do not worry as your problem is treatable. Tab clonazepam tab fluoxetine tab fluvoxaminetab buspirone. These Chat Doctor. Side by side behavioral therapy. Contact to psychiatrist as these 

input: Hi, my dad (84) has been diagnosed with another bleed on the left side of his brain. He had an annuryism in the same spot 20 years ago and he had surgery to correct the bleed then. He was left paralyzed on the left side. Because of his age we have opted not to have any surgery as he has been through so much in the last 20 years. He has spent 15 yrs in a nursing home. The ER doctor who saw him told us of this second bleed and also that he will die and that all they can do is keep him comfortable. How long do you think my dad will lie like this? The bleed was found on Wednesday of last week. I just do not want him to suffer and he seems to be resting peacefully and even ackowledging us with a nod of his head occassionally. He is holding his own as far as his lungs and heart goes and is passing the fluids that they are giving him now. The only symptom he had to alert us something was wrong was is low oxygen levels and this is why we had him taken to the hospital. Any info you can give us will be greatly appreciated.
output: Hello, You have most of the information that you should know, and you also have absorbed it the way it should have been. Beyond the present supportive care, there is nothing much that may be required for him. A major part of brain his not functioning for him and at such an old age when organ systems start giving in one by one, one can only try to give him peaceful and comfortable existence as long as he pulls on. Good luck.

input: doctor told me that i am severely anemic they gave me some iron tablets but i didnt take that and in its replacement i just drunk beet root s juice 4 hours ago, now i am having fast heartbeat please tell me any home remedy, keeping my situation in eye, i think i cant bear any high mg or iron medicine....i am having chest infection and cough as well as ALSAR. i am 47 years old lady
output: Severe anemia needs urgent treatment. Neither iron tablets nor beet root juice will help you if you have severe anemia. Moreover, if you have ulcer(hope I am taking it correct sense for ALTAR), iron preparations can irritate your digestive system. People with severe anemia, having symptom like faster heart beat, should immediately see a doctor. Take care

But I found it not suitable for me. I lost 2 month for treatment. Now I have been treated with folitrax 15 mg injection and I found it is ok for me. Pl advise how to get strength as I am bed ridden and could not walk properly without support. Also my back joints L4 L5 etc are giving lot of pain. Pl advise remedy.
output: Hello, Low back pain in psoriasis arthritis have different origin. This pain is mostly due to increase in inflammation. In your case two factors are playing role one is your disease & other is your inactivity with your age. In my opinion if you are facing severe problem with low back pain then you may ask from your doctor about intermittent course of low dose steroid. This is very helpful in such cases. Your doctor is the sole person to decide its pros and cons in your age. You should continue or start calcium & vitamin D therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care 

input: I have a recurring lump on the back of my neck below my hairlinr and above my shoulders. it hurts to the touch. It seems that every now and again it becomes immflamed and swells which is when it hurts. other times it is smaller but I can still feel it?
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. The typical character of the lump you described looks most probably to be an infected sebaceous cyst. Although the infection is mild and recurrent. This does not look to be lipoma. The best way to get a diagnosis is clinical and excision. This helps in 2 ways:1. You get disease free.2 get a definite diagnosis. So please go ahead with the excision-removal.

output: Hi, Watch out for XXXXXWelcome to Chat Doctor, You can take Literal 500 mg daily and not on alternate day for not more than 3-4 days. You can take capsule Doxycycline once a day for 10-15 days instead of Literal. Ok and bye.

input: hi my lft report range are as follow .Iam bit confused regarding the range serum bilirubin(diazo method).....   .93 mg/dldirect                                               .50indirect                                            .43sgot ifcc method                              93.8 iu/lsgpt                                                 148.5 iu/l
output: Hellhole me explain to you that, what is got Sept. In your case serum bilirubin level is normal so need not worry. The aminotransferase is sensitive indicators of LIVER CELL INJURY and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular disease such as HEPATITIS. They include the aspartame aminotransferase (GOT) and the alpine aminotransfearse (Sept). Sgot is found in liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in DECREASING disorder of concentration. Sgpt is mainly found in the liver. I want to explain to you that any mild disease or any injury to above-mentioned organs may be responsible for high level of GOT. While primarily Sept is in liver, so any cell injury to liver cells may be responsible for liver disease. But this level is not so high so at present need not worry, if you didn't have any other symptoms. Keep regular watch over liver function tests and symptoms. Besides avoid wine, Chat Doctor. Still if you have any doubt get in MRI and ultrasound of liver. Consult a physician and get his opinion as physical examination is also important. Good luck.

input: Hello Doc. I am currently taking meloxicam, and was wondering, can I take tylenol for my muscle pain? I take a half of my meloxicam as needed and the last time I took one was this morning. I ve been having muscle pain on my left side about a week now and I am trying determine my pain level. Arlene
output: Hello, I have studied your case. Yes you can take Tylenol for muscle pain. Be aware of side effects of Tylenol. Side effects such as dizziness, Chat Doctor.

input: Me and my gf were fooling around i had gotten cum on my to stop from cuming in her after i pulled out. After i washed my hands with soap and water. About an our later we fooled around again. Could she get pregnant even after i washed the cum my hands?
output: Hi their have understood your concern. If you had this unprotected sex act in the fertile period of her cycle then she should take emergency contraceptive pills within 72 hours of unprotected sex act. As you might be aware that pre ejaculation fluid contains sperms enough to cause pregnancy. And it gets deposited without you noticing it. So even if you pull out before ejaculation, it is not a safe sex. It is not due to washed hands but due to pull out method, she stands chance to get pregnant. I hope this answer helps you. Thansk.

input: I had a gastroscopy and was diagnosed with the beginning of stomach ulcers , I was put onto a 2 week course of antibiotics (Moxypen & Klarithran) which I m still taking as well as Topzole, for the last 3 days I have had severe swelling of my ankles and feet and even my eyelids are swollen and I feel flushed all the time, could there be a relation between the symptoms and the medication??
output: Hi, Thanks for posting your query. I am Chat Doctor. The swelling you have in the ankles, feet and around the eyelids is not related to the stomach ulcers or the medications you take. Swelling like these occurs due to either heart, liver or kidney diseases. Puffiness around the eyes usually occurs in kidney disease. You need to get tests done to see which of these organs is affected causing the swelling of the ankle, feet and around eyes. I hope that answers your question.

input: I m on sprintec for few months. I never missed a pill and I always take it on time?But the other day I missed then I took two pills yesterday with one hour in between. Today I took my dose about 2 hours and 10 minutes late. I had sex tonight. Is there any chance to be pregnant? WWW.WWWW.WW
output: Hello, Thanks for your query.sprinter is used to prevent ovulation. As you missed one dose and compensated it next day by taking 2 pills. Though you have taken your dose little late but still you have same chances of pregnancy when you use pills promptly/regularly.  So don't worry and read carefully instructions provided with your medicine. If you miss one active pill, take two pills on the day that you remember. Then take one pill per day for the rest of the pack. If you miss two active pills in a row in Week 1 or 2, take two pills per day for two days in a row. Then take one pill per day for the rest of the pack. Use back-up birth control for at least 7 days following the missed pills. Hope it helps. Take care!

output: Hi there. Delayed periods with cramps could be due to Endometriosis or Adenomyosis and associated hormonal disturbance. You need to get an Ultrasound done and also hormonal assays of FSH, LH, Estrogen and Progesterone. This will give a clear picture of the problem and the appropriate treatment. Take Tablet Metal spas if you have a lot of cramps.

You have started on Glycogen Sr 1 gm before dinner, along with you are doing yoga, gym, walk regularly diet control. With all these efforts your blood sugar levels are fairly controlled. I would like to advise_1. Strictly follow Diabetic diet regularly. 2. Continue yoga, gym, walk regularly. 3. Continue Tab Glycogen Sr 1gm after dinner. In fact, you can increase the dose up to 1.5 gm and over another 15 days to 2 gm total per day in divided doses preferred to take after meals. (effective dose is approximately 1.75 gm per day) As this medicine rarely decreases blood sugar levels below normal level (rarely causes hypoglycemia) This medicine act on basic pathology of diabetes called insulin resistance. As Diabetes is lifelong disease, as duration of diabetes increases there may need of additional medicines. 4. You have not mentioned your height and weight so that you should target weight loss according to your height. 5. Certain blood test are important like lipid profile, serum creatinine, HbA1C which denote blood sugar level over period of approximately 120 days. Urinary protein creatinine ratio, Endoscopy to rule out diabetic retinopathy. 6. You should also start medicine for lowering lipids despite your lipid level, if it is in normal range start in basic dose and if in higher doses according to lipid level. 7.

input: My mother is having lightheadiness and heart palpitations and sometimes her hear races. This has been over the last few days. She just checked her blood pressure and it is normal and her pulse rate is 72. Could she still have a heart attack with normal blood pressure and pulse rate? Thanks, Kelli
output: Hi, Lightheadedness associated with palpitations can be caused by irregularities in heart rhythm.  Heart rate and blood pressure can be normal in these cases, but it is important to know what her heart rhythm is, and what is usually done is an ECG which documents the electrical activity of the heart. It may not be a "heart attack" per se, but it is noteworthy that she may undergo tests as part of the work-up.  And I would suggest a consult with a doctor to be able to check other causes of dizziness such as a musculoskeletal problem in the neck, as well as problems in the eyes and ears which may cause dizziness, apart from a problem in the heart. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. From your history, and ultrasound report of fluid in the cul-de-sac, I would suspect you to be having a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) which might also be associated with a UTI (urinary tract infection), which had to be ruled out by a culture and sensitivity test. If I were your doctor, I after a general physical examination of yours would advise you to get yourself assessed by a gynecologist of your area to rule this out specially if you are sexually active. Till then, I would advise you for a course of broad spectrum antibiotics along with an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: Respected Sir,My name is Nishanth singh gurung. I have undergone a root canal treatment 8 months back. One of my teeths in the bottom section is growing at 70% angle outwards. It is causing a problem in the gums. I always feel some sensitivity there and not able to study properly. Please tell me what i have to do. Its urgent
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The sensitivity in the tooth can be because of the cervical abrasion(Wearing away of tooth structure) since it is in an abnormal position, more force will be applied when you brush. The other possible cause can be a dental caries in between the teeth. So consult an oral physician and get it evaluated and take a radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. If the tooth is a wisdom tooth, then get it removed. If it is some other tooth, you can get it restored a cement material. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: Hi, I m 38 years old and due to a gun shot through the roof of my mouth.I have worn a partial for years. I m 5 1 amd 91 lbs always been very small child like. I had full dentures put in yesterday and they huge! I m gagging,cant close my mouth,color is very dark,and teeth are like hores teeth. I m horrified. I have called him and he said the will fit when I grow into them. I don t think I m going to be doing anymore of that. What to do? He pulled what 10 teeth I had left now nothing and owe him over 5,000$. Help PLEASE
output: Hi, Thank you for the query.  First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care.

My neuro surgeon say the fusion is fine and healing well. What would you advise
output: Hello, I have studied your case. You may need to do MRI spine again to see for nerve compression Due to compression of this nerve root there is tingling numbness in your leg and pain associated with it. If there is instability then fusion with fixation may help. As per your previous surgery of spine now there is possibility of discuss, which can be confirmed by MRI with contrast or CT pyelogram.

input: I just had an MRI on thursday, Ive had many MRIs in the last 10 years but this was my first experience in a 3.0 Tesla imaging unit. I have relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and am on Tysabri as my disease modifying drug, I have tested positive for the JC virus {papovavirus} and so my MRIs are to watch out for possible signs of PML.

input: Hi, im a 27 yr old female and over the past 2 yrs i have been getting left sided chest pain, and pain in my left rib that also radiates to the back. my 3rd rib is protruding as thats what my doctor said. i feel breathless n i get skipped hb everyime i get pain in that rib. I have had x rays done but everything seems normal.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Mild Breathlessness, skipped heart beat, left sided chest pain etc. can be seen in arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). So first get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. In my opinion, your pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal cause. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Sit with proper back and chest support. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Woke up with a discoloration on my left hand and some swelling around my middle finger . Now it looks like I have a huge bruise on my hand from knuckle on my middle finger to whole back of hand to the wrist . I do not remember hitting it on anything. I was lifting a canoe while I was camping a few days ago. I am on blood pressure medication and one half of a water pill plus baby aspirin .This is because I only have one functioning kidney due to chemo damage to my left kidney

input: :) hey i got a question .. so yeah i had a root canal on one tooth and  being lazy i forgot to get the permanent filling and as time passed my tooth fell out .. so my question is .. Can i still get infection there even if i had a root canal and forgot to get the filling and my tooth fell out ??
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The chances of root canal treated tooth getting infected is very less unless it is not properly treated. The fell out tooth structure could be only the crown portion. The Root canal treated tooth becomes weak after RCT, so it has to be crowned immediately.

output: Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your daughters history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know more about her milk allergy symptoms. How was milk allergy diagnosed? If she is really allergic to milk, taking any milk product (be it curd, buttermilk, butter, milk biscuits, milk chocolates, etc.) can cause her allergic reactions.2. If she is not taking any milk products and still she develops allergic reactions, I would suggest allergy testing for other foods such as soy, ground nut, wheat, rice, egg, seafoods, tree nuts, etc. This will help you to identify the allergy, if any.3. Hives can occur even without allergies. Possible causes are viral infections, bacterial infections, parasites, Chat Doctor. 4. As she is getting hives since 2 months, I usually suggest my such patients investigations like serum total IGE, allergy testing for common allergens, complete blood counts, ESR, stool examination, urine examination, etc. However, before suggesting investigations, I always take a detailed history about her each and every symptom, diet, environment,

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, fluid aspiration from neck abscess is must for the diagnosis of type of infection. Since you are diabetic, this kind of purulent infection can be seen with mixed infection like aerobic, anaerobic bacteria with tuberculosis. So abscess fluid (pus) culture and sensitivity report is needed. Culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. For this we need abscess material, and it is available only after aspiration. It is not much painful procedure. Intensity of pain will be similar to simple needle prick. If you're really afraid of pain then ask your use local anesthetic agent (lidocaine) before the procedure. Don't worry, this won't cause pain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: My husband is having a dull tightness in his right abdomen. He describes it as a feeling of being full after eating small meals and a feeling that his stomach is balled up in one area. He has been very gassy and sometimes a pain or an uncomfortable feeling is there and stays there for a while until he lays down. He states that when he lifts his arms up there is a feeling like it is being pulled because of how tight it is. He has had blood work, stool samples, x-rays, liver enzyme test, pretty much everything except for a CT or MRI and everything has came back normal but he is still having the same feeling. We do not have a clue as to what else could be causing this.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Just to recapitulate: dull tightness in right abdomen - full after eating small meals - balled up in one area-gassy- being pulled because of how tight it is.-everything except for a CT or MRI- I would advise starting with a simple investigation like: Plain X-ray of the whole abdomen in the standing position-this may show air-fluid shadow if intestinal obstruction. Yes, CT will definitely help the diagnosis. In the meantime he should stop all the foods and beverages that you both have observed to have increased the problem. The treatment will depend upon the diagnosis and can be medical or surgical. There is a possibility of an inflammatory process going on in abdomen with added intestinal obstruction.

Will this heal the toe in a few days and it s all healed,
output: This should be looked at by a foot and ankle specialist. You didn't mention your age or vascular status. In the worst case scenario this can be a gangrenous situation setting it. Assuming you are young and healthy that should not be the case. If your nails are too long they can bang into the front of your shoe causing a separation of the nail from the nail bed or bleeding under the nail which causes pressure and pain. If there is blood under the nail the blood would need to be released to relieve the pain. Another cause of a ring on the toe is ringworm which is a fungal infection-though, that is usually not severely painful as you describe

output: Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain, you have done all the examinations, and they result normal. According to this, we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long. If you tell that you still have high blood pressure values despite your treatment, it means that you have to rise your medication to better control your blood pressure. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h, to know your mean values. After that if they result high I will add another medicament or rise the dosage of your existing ones. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.

input: Hi there. Ive been having significant drops in my H&H. I dont have my print out with me, but I am reticing. My Iron saturation is 4. Im going to assume I have fibriods? Each month my CBC values have been declining. My question is : Will I need a transfusion if I postpone getting my fibriods removed?
output: Based on your query my opinion is1. Yes, fibroid can cause a fall in hemoglobin values and parameters related to RBC.2. This is explained by the effect of sub mucosal fibroid which can cause increased bleeding, so blood loss results in decrease RBC counts and Hemoglobin.3. You need to get it removed if it is a large fibroid and sub mucosal in location.4. Transfusion requirements depend on how much your Hemoglobin is. If it's less than 7, you will require transfusion, if not it can be corrected by parenteral iron therapy. Hope this helpsRegards

input: I recently had a 9mm Kidney Stone laser blasted in July.  My CT showed smaller stones in both my kidneys. A week after the surgery I had the stent removed. Later that night I passed a 3mm stone. A recent x-ray showed a stone in my right kidney and minute stone in my left kidney. The stone that was blasted was analyzed.

input: Hi, My youngest son was sick for two days with a fever. I took both boys to the doctor yesterday and my oldest son got a tb test. He is now running a high fever 102-103. Should I rush him to the hospital? Normally I wouldn t go to the hospital unless the fever reaches 104 but I m just concern because he had a TB done yesterday
output: Hi, Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.  If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.  Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.  I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

input: Hi Doc, I hv problem of blemishes on my face n my skin specialist hs suggested Melacare but I don t know for how long should I use it so it won t give me bad effects. I hv pigmentation on some parts of my face so can I use iy there to get flawless skin?
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. From your history, the blemishes on your face could be due to plasma, freckles or even post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Melacare contains a steroid as one of its components which over long term use can cause side effects like skin thinning, redness and whitish discoloration. It should be used only under the guidance of your dermatologist. You could also benefit from using a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30and above every 4 hours even indoors and in cloudy weather.  You could use a lightening cream containing 2 % comic acid, licorice, albumin and niacin amide which is safer and devoid of steroidal side effects. You could also get glycol peels done by a qualified dermatologist. Hope this helps you. Take care.

input: Hi there, I have had a mole like bump on my arm for a couple of years now and the majority of the time it is normal (slightly raised) but every month or so its swells ( as if it is filled with fluid) it is bery hard and it gets a white ring around it, around the white ring the skin is red and looks aggravated. The thing is it only stays like it for a few hour and then in goes back to normal. thanks

input: My friend had a pilodontal cyst that turned into a massive growth. He had it almost completely removed but it is deep to his tailbone and about 5in wide. His dr said today he had a rare form of squamous cancer but that is about all he was told. Can you help out. He was also told there was only about 48 cases since 2007 that have presented with this form of cancer
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. A colonial cyst is a condition which occurs in the skin over the gluteal cleft due to low intensity chronic irritation. This is treated by wide excision and I understand that your friend has got it done. The treatment of excising it till the tailbone is as recommended and his doctor gave him the right treatment. Unfortunately it has turned out as a squamous cell cancer in the biopsy report and this might require aggressive treatment. Multi modality treatment approach might be required. Since surgery is done this might be followed up by chemotherapy and radiation therapy depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer. It is being found that radiation therapy works better for squamous cell cancer of the colonial cyst. Please do not worry.

input: My left testical on the very top feels mushy and strained out, but feels normal towards the bottom. The right one is completely normal. I read a few similar things about this.. So far I gathered that it could be testicular cancer or that my left nut could be sterile.Could you please help me! Im a little frightened.
output: Hi, It is generally believed that if you experience pain on squeezing the testicle, it is unlikely to be cancer. This need not apply in every case, but helps. An ultrasound of testes can mostly differentiate an infection from cancer. I suggest you get it done rather than worrying about the possibility of cancer.  Hope this helped.

input: Hi, so my mom s been experiencing an aching from her right leg and it kinda has bruises (it doesn t really have the same color of the typical bruise you know, but to the spot where it aches and we can clearly see that her right leg s way bigger than the other, so it has a huge dark spot on that area I don t really know what is it called) so anyway, she s been experiencing it for almost a year now. Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now. So please do help me, because I really love my mom and seeing her like that pains me. Thank you!
output: Hello, Dark bruise on the leg with chronic pain is commonly due to Thrombocytopenia (Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura / Heparin induced thrombocytopenia). She can take Acetaminophen (Tylenol), one SOS when required for relieve from pain. She can apply ointment Thrombophob or Thrombophob gel locally on the area affected to reduce the dark bruise. However, other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms are Superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation / swelling of a vein due to a blood clot), Hematoma, Deep vein thrombosis, varicose vein complications, etc. You are suggested to visit ER, get your mother clinically examined by a GP, get Blood & Imaging tests done at the earliest. She may be referred to a Hematologist or Immunologist. Her treatment will depend on the severity of the pathology detected. Let the disease detected & get her treated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: Hello i have been having a problem with a swollen lump on the side of my neck near my chin. sometimes it will be painful and there will be a sudden "burst" of the lump and and i can taste a bitter fluid coming up my throat. is that a swollen lymph gland?
output: HI. The history of burst of the lump and giving bitter fluid in mouth may be due to the swelling and infection of the submandibular salivary gland. The causes cane : stone in the duct of the gland or a stricture in the duct or infection and inflammation of the gland. I would advise having a clinical examination by the Surgeon or the ENT Surgeon by putting a gloved finger and palpate for the stone and the gland. If there is an impacted stone in the ducts, this can be easily removed and a few stitches to invert the opening so that the complication is reduced. If there is a gland infection with the swelling and stones, this may have to be removed.

input: Doctor my baby is 2 months old..From birth she is feeding Lactogen1 no breast milk. I tried a lot of medicines for breast milk but failed.The matter is that the stool of baby is having foul smell. And her motion is too difficult hardly one times in a day. Is there any problem.
output: Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. When the child is unable to digest it, the undigested remains are degraded by intestinal bacteria to produce foul smelling gases. I would suggest getting a stool routine microscopy (including test for reducing substances) to be done. Treatment will depend on the results. In any case, I would suggest changing the formula to a soy based formula and see if there is a difference.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My husband had bowel cancer surgery in 2009 and has just had a CT Scan and has been told the cancer has returned to the pelvic area and lymph nodes and cannot have further surgery. Does this mean he is terminally ill?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bowel cancer is difficult to treat in some patients and your husband might have had a recurrence lymph node involvement. In this situation there is disease spread to the regional lymph nodes and this make it difficult to operate. However, treatment should be started after COSI Chat Doctor. Many patients can have good response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and show significant reduction in size of lymph nodes. This can then be assessed again and a staging can be done and if possible then operated at a later date. Bowel cancer is also seen to spread to liver in nearly half the patients, and therefore it will help to check on the liver from time to time by ultrasound scan or CT scan. Lungs should also be screened regularly. Hope he recovers with treatment. Please do not worry.

input: My almost 9 month old has a rash/hives around the edges of her diaper, armpits, belly and backs of her legs. We just started introducing solid foods. We introduced oatmeal yesterday. She had a virus a week ago. No fever, just vomiting for about 8 hours. She s had a bit of loose stool this week. is this a food allergy or a continuation of whatever she had last week?
output: HI ...this is not suggestive of food allergy. This is classically fitting into eczema as it is involving the flexural surfaces of the body. The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be Chat Doctor.  For this oil massage and lotions like Hiatus will help. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months of age, and they gradually get better. Regards - 

input: For the past 3 to 6 months, i have been having daily minor giddiness and lightheaded - but not to the point of losing my balance. I am able to do 100% of my day to day basis, however, due to its daily presence (of minor giddiness and lightheaded), it makes me very worried. What could it be and what type of doctor should i see?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor! After reading your question it comes out that you are having some giddiness and lightheaded less from past 3-6 months, but it is not affecting your life. Had I been at your place I think I would meet a general physician or medicine specialist?  To me, it appears to be either some blood pressure problem or may be a case of cervical spondylosis. Getting your routine tests and BP checked will rule put some usual causes. You are right in finding for its cause as even though this is not disturbing you life, but this is a symptom, and it should not be there. Anyway, it looks to be only some minor problem, so donor worry a lot, see a doctor. Only after examining you one can pinpoint the reason. Hope the reply is usefulness free to ask more questions

input: Hello , my 7 year old daughter has a large lump under her tongue . I have been to the doctors but referred to specialist . Im really worried as its stopping her eating as she complains it hurt after eating and her speech is now being effected . I have pictures if you require them .
output: Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. A large lump under the tongue in a child should not be ignored and needs an attention of a specialist like a Pediatric Surgeon or ENT surgeon because not only affect the voice but also air entry and respiration and there may be a lot of saliva formation which may lead to aspiration pneumonia. There may be multiple causes like manual, any mucous retention cyst, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc. All of them have different pathology and so, the treatment is also different. Please show it to the doctor and the child may require an imaging modality like CT scans and a biopsy for the diagnosis and once the diagnosis is confirmed, excision may be required after pretreatment.

input: My son has Isthmic Spondylolisthesis.  He also suffers from vertigo and dizzy spells.  Hes had a lot ot testing to ensure there isnt any underlying condition causing the vertigo/dizziness.  Weve never put it together until recently...when I read that spondylol can cause vertigo.  Is this true?
output: Hi, thank you for posting. I have gone through your query and I understand your concerns. It is true that Islamic Spondylolisthesis can cause dizziness. This condition causes neck muscular spasm. In patients with Islamic Spondylolisthesis blood flow to the brain base is low due to muscular spasm, and this is the reason why patients have dizziness. The treatment of this condition contains painkillers and muscle relaxant medications. A neck X-ray, a complete blood count and a urine test are necessary in order to check the condition of the patient. If the condition is aggravated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are necessary. Chiropractic procedures can also help. You should contact a neurologist to discuss the treatment. All the best.

input: I have just had breast cancer surgery 9 days ago. the margins are clear, but it was estrogen/progesterone positive. They want to do chemo and radiation, but I feel there has to be a better approach in treating this. I work for a naturopath, but his specialty is not chemo or radiation, but would like someone who will work with him in my care.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months. Radiation is precise and specific to the region of cancer. Please do not worry.

input: I have weight issues but over the last 12 months  my asthma as changed its breathless all the time feeling of pressure on my chest breathing worse at night waking gasping also legs very swollen also arms and girth sometimes swollen Im exhausted all the time

But with the history of asthma, you must mention at what age you started having asthmatic attacks, any precipitant factors of asthma, on what medications you are, and do you have a history of hypertension.

output: Hello. I just read through your question. The most common reason for what you describe is nasal congestion. Usually this is cleared by simply blowing the nose and perhaps administering saline nose Chat Doctor.  However, this could sometimes be an issue with the lungs (i.e.: wheezing). If she is otherwise comfortable, I don't consider this an emergency. However, I do recommend consulting with your pediatrician.

input: I have had what started as a rash 3 months ago.  I spent the previous night in a hospital, because I took a spill at home.  Soon this rash turned into severe hives on face, thigh, arms (inside elbow) and mainly the right side of my back (which is the side I sleep on) and my breasts (which is where the nightgown in the hospital rested.  That was the end of February and now its May and the itching especially on my breasts and under my left arm (and down the arm to inside of the elbow.The itching and little bumps (like hives) are so bad you wouldnt believe it. Doctor gave me Triamcinolone 0.1% cream, but it doesnt do that well.  I tried Cortiscone from the drug store..not that great either.  Im taking Bensdryl tablets, because they did control the hives pretty well, but this rash and all the little bumps are killing me.
output: Hello, With such presentations in my clinic, I would first rule out underlying causes responsible for your rash rather treating symptomatically for months.

Is this is cause of concern? how to get the liver normal. i walk for one hour almost 4 times a week. drink and smoke socially. Any medicine to cure fatty liver ??
output: Hi and Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern for the fatty liver. You need to have some lifestyle modifications in order to get rid of fatty liver:1. Since you are overweight (BMI is 26.49), your maximum healthy weight based on a BMI of 25 is 78.32 kg. So, continue regular physical activities in addition to walking2. Avoid fatty meals (both vegan and non-vegan), fast and junk foods, salted snacks, Chat Doctor. 

input: hi i think am pregnant,have been on atripla for about a year and some 3 mths,i have no complaints with my my medication,my fear now is i am not ready to have an abortion and yet am scared for the new born and also ready to live with the conquences and outcomes of my new baby as nothing can make me or convince me to abort am about two weeks or so advise pls am ready to die if need be
output: Hi. Atripla belongs to pregnancy category D classified by the FDA, meaning that the medication does hold some side effects during pregnancy, but is nothing serious enough and also not much thought needs to be out in by the doctor before prescribing or continuing the medication during pregnancy. So I don't think there should be an impact of the Chat Doctor. Best wishes.

input: Hi. Last night and again today, I ve noticed a large and noticeable pulsation in my neck in the area of the carotid artery. It s especially pronounced when I m supine. This afternoon, while at work, I noticed the pulsations in my neck and then, shortly after, realized my right hand was shaking and the arm felt weak. It subsided after a few minutes. When I returned home this evening, I noticed the beating in my neck and, using a video camera on my phone, confirmed the pulsations are visible and most visible when I m lying down or back on pillows. I feel okay otherwise, although my arm and shoulder again feel a little strange. (Although, truthfully, I m wondering if I m just reading into things a little bit.) I do have a history of heart issues: I had a patent foramen ovale closed in my heart in 2010 due to several years worth of strange symptoms (visual, pins & needles, etc.) that were likely ongoing and sporadic TIAs, according to my cardiologists. I have had no repeat episodes since the surgery, although have had a few cases of pericarditis since then. Otherwise, I am in excellent health/fitness. Weight ~130. Height ~5 6 . Physically active, no drug use, occasional social alcohol use. No family history of cardio disease. The question: should I be concerned about these symptoms and go to the ER, or is it normal? Or, somewhere in between those two extremes?
output: HIF you see carotid pulsations or jugular vein pulsations and felt weakness of arm simultaneously and with history of heart operation, you may consult a cardiologist for it. You may also watch if you get rapid pulse or irregular radial pulse, some symptoms of dizziness or not.I may suggest an echocardiogram to record the chamber functions, valves and pressure gradients to rule out any abnormalities of atria and ventricle size

input: Hi, I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?
output: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,

input: Hello, I was diagonised with hepatitise B for the last seven months back, my first doctor has put me on antivairal drugs lemuvudine but later i was advise by the second doctor to stop taking the medicine becouse the vairal load was low and it doesn t qualified me for treatment and later liver biospy was done but i don t have the varius in my liver but since then my liver enzyems keep on elevating especially the alt , alkaline, billrubin, total protein , ggt & at times the mentions ones also reduce though HIV B varial load was done later and it was below 25mm in DNA . What could be the problem am so scared of liver concer and chriosis. Secondly can someone grow up with hepatitise B from child hood up to the age of 60s? if so what is the life span of the person having a chronic HIV B?
output: If you have elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis B you should probably get treatment, but it also depends on the results of your liver biopsy (if there is active inflammation or not). Also getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are coinfected with HIV, then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B. Keep in mind that some HIV medications also work against Hepatitis B (such as tenofovir, also known as Arvada) reasons why your doctor may have stopped lamivudine.

output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is unlikely that this injury would have significantly affected your ability to conceive. There are different reasons for infertility. It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive. I hope this helps

input: I had a crown put in three years ago.  I had not noticed any pain or problem with it, yet the dentist says he needs to replace it because there is decay under it.  Is this unusual? I thought crowns were permanent.  Should I get a second opinion, and how do I go about doing that??

As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown. You can take a second opinion if you wish as well as you can send me a scan of the x Ray of the crowned tooth so that I can guide you how you should proceed for treatments. In case if tooth is decayed then the treatment advised to you is appropriate. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I can understand your emotions. In psychology, we broadly call it obsession. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and focused. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: Hi, my lower back usually is sore. Im only 17 and already have back pains. But today, Ive been having lower pains by my spin, but of to the right a little, near my butt. Usually when I have back pains, I lay on a hard flat surface and it feels like my back shifts into place, but this time when I did it, it cracked about 7 times, then I felt a major pain so I rolled over to my stomach, cried for a few seconds, and stood up. I thought the pain was gone, til I started walking around again? I already been told my back was mis aligned. but I have no clue what this is.

input: Hi, I m an 8 year colon cancer survivor. I had my colon removed at initial diagnosis and have been very healthy since then. June of 2011 I say block stools for two weeks after some hard training for a race. A blood test indicated I was anemic. I took some medicine for a month and my numbers returned to normal. This June and July I saw black stools again and my numbers were low. I ve had upper scops and a camera pill that show nothing major, just slight erosions of the esophogus. I have not seen any block stools since July (not Sept) but my Hemoglobin is still at 12.6. I ve been on Prilosec for 3 months now and it doesn t seem to be helping. I mountain bike very hard (race too) and play volleyball alot. About 6-10 hours of excercise a week. I feel ok although I am not as fast on the bike as I used to be. My question is, what do you think I should be asking my docs to look at now and is it safe to keep pushing my body with a 12.6 hemoglobin count? I ve read this can put strain on the body. Thanks.
output: Normal hemoglobin level for men is 13.8 to 18.0 g/DL. Your hemoglobin of 12.6 is not that low and upper GI endoscopy is normal. But since u had colon cancer in past I would suggest u undergo colonoscopy and blood for CEA test. Yearly CT scan of chest and whole abdomen should also be done for colon cancer. Regards and Take care

input: My sister goes to the oncologist Thursday after additional tests to confirm aortic cancer. I have never heard of this cancer and have gotten little even general understanding from the internet. Can you possibly enlighten me as to what it is , the prognosis (aggressive, treatment, rare, etc.)? Virginia Lanter
output: Hi dear. I also have not heard of any variety of such cancer. You should send other reports to get more information. A cancer arising from aorta may be referred to as aortic cancer. Depending on its extent surgery may be done to have cure.

input: My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer that has also spread to the liver . The cancer in size are the size of a grain of rice. I have seen charts where cancer starts out like a grain of rice,pea,grape ect.. all the way up to a golf ball. So my question is : Does the size of the cancer mean that he has a greater chance of survival with treatment now because the cancer is still so small? Or in a stage 4 diapnoses the size of the cancer doesn t matter.....
output: Hi, In some sort of cancer even in stage 4 cancer there is chance of complete cure. But unfortunately pancreatic cancer is not of this category. Stage 4 disease has guarded prognosis. Now some more information will be helpful like his liver function test, no. of liver metastasis, routine blood test to have a more elaborate discussion. Anyway size of primary in pancreas matters little in the setting of metastatic disease. Consult your doctor.

output: Hi, thanks for the brief history of you.

There are chances you get infection frequently. Why don't you meet up the surgeon and discuss if you can do some exercises.

input: I have anxiety. At my Dr appt. yesterday my bp was 138/96 and my pulse rate 98. Previous 2 appointments over last year or so was 138/96 and 138/94. Im concerned, but doctor just seems to think anxiety, yet due to anxiety I can feel my heart racing multiple times throughout the day. I feel sick.
output: Hi, I can understand the distress you might be having due to anxiety. Anxiety disorders can lead to multiple symptoms like worries, palpitations, sweating, tremors, Blood pressure fluctuations, etc. I suggest you seek a psychiatric consultation for the same. Baseline investigations like complete blood counts, thyroid profile and ECG would be required to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Treatment with medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors will be helpful in your condition. In addition, you should start exercising daily. That will help in reduction of anxiety. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.

input: Hi , my son is 3 years 3 months old he has allergy and uses levolin puff . His spasm is not acute but often suffers with it during change of season. recently he has been prescribed Budecort 200 two puffs twice daily for three months. I am a little uncomfortable with the use of steroid at this age he weighs 20 kgs and is almost 3 feet tall. Want your advice regarding the side effects
output: Hi, I admire your positive outlook regarding the query. For asthma management, physicians need to advice various medications which depends on its severity and control.>Leveling acts by dilating air passages and relieves acute breathlessness.>On the other hand, Decor which is an steroid act by reducing inflammation which prevents as well as controls frequent asthma symptoms. It has some side effects like fungal infections of mouth and throat (Candidiasis). Systemic steroid effects on higher doses like mood changes, hyperglycemia, smell & taste disturbances, osteoporosis etc. Your son has been prescribed Decor two puffs of 200 micrograms twice daily that means a total of 800 micrograms which equals to 0.8 mg only. Moreover, very little amount of steroid is absorbed as it is used via inhalation.Therefore, its side effect is almost negligible except candidiasis. That is why your child is advised to gurgle his mouth with plain water after taking puffs which will prevent candidiasis. I presume that a diagnosis of probable asthma has been made and given proper medicine accordingly. Hope this answers your query. Wishing your son good health.

input: I m desperate to find a specialist in the Pittsburgh, PA or surroundings, who specializes in treating black mold illnesses. My daughter is very ill due to spending 1 year in an apartment where the landlord refused to do anything about it.

This is not the first time we had sex and every time we have had sexual intercourse we have been careful and used a condom while I have also been on birth control.

We believe that the head of his penis was only exposed for about 1-3 minutes before he pulled out and we realized what happened. 3 minutes being the most.

input: I have two infected teeth at the moment, swollen glands are present as well. They re abscessed, I m sure. So, my question is this: I have full scripts of both 500mg Cefuroxime as well as 500mg Amoxicillin. I can t get to the dentist until this Friday and I need to start a round of something NOW, because, for obvious reasons, the dentist will not pull teeth as infected as mine presently are. I m sure that the Amoxicillin would be the best choice, even though the Cefuroxime is stronger.

I know I need to get to the dentist, but please, which would you recommend?

Antibiotics and analgesics will give a temporary relief unless the tooth is treated with Root canal treatment you will face pain and infection, I would suggest you to consult a nearby Dentist get an x-ray done and start with the treatment. Hope you find this as helpful, Take care!

input: hi. My 15 year old girl has been waking up sat, sun and today with swelling in her fingers, and ankles and complains of itching different parts of body, feet, hands, and tops of legs, back. I think she has been laying in bed too long, prolonged sitting, and drinking lots of chocolate/banana smoothies, not enough water. I have told her to move around, drink water, and back off on smoothies in diet, I also told he she could take benedryll liquid and apply cream. Any other suggestions?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint sudden swelling in fingers and ankles along with itching or Urticaria in different body parts seems to be most probably be due to allergic reaction to some unknown allergen. It can be due to a number of things certain insect/bug bites, poison ivy, skin cosmetics, detergents, foods, leather, latex, medicines etc. It can also be due to mite infestation causing Scabies. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and blood tests can help in confirming the diagnosis and treatment can be planned accordingly. You can be advised to take anti allergic like Allegra or Clarity, apply steroid ointment, do cool compresses over the body and apply calamine lotion. In case of Scabies you can be advised to apply Preterit lotion and take Ivermectin. You can also be advised anti allergic along to relieve itching. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

input: I had cervical cancer Stage 2B in 2008. I m now considered in remission even though last years PAP my doctor said came back abnormal. He said that as long as my cell count was below 32 I would still be considered in remission. I m confused. Do I have a new type of cancer? Does this mean I m only considered out of remission when the cell count is high enough for them to treat?
output: Hi and thank you so much for this query. It is difficult to tell what your doctors are referring to as remission. What treatment options were to offered after the diagnosis of this cancer? Also, what were the immediate controls after the treatment. Are the counts still same or are they increasing? If they are still same and not increasing, then there is no reason to get worried. However, if the counts are increasing, even below the mentioned 32, it is enough reason to get concerned. I hope this helps. I wish you well. Thank you so much for using our services and do feel free to ask for more information and clarifications if need be.

output: Hello, The general validity of a TMT is 12-18 months, so if you have done is just recently, and it was normal you may not repeat it, however your doctor would have planned a review if the last TMT was borderline, or your blood pressure may have shot up, or you were unable to walk to the desired level of activity.  However, you need not worry about it as till now you haven't done a TMT, and the last was good according to the information provided . Even if your TMT comes positive there are still 30% change that the report is false positive.  So don't take unnecessary stress of the future. Hoping I could help. Regards Chat Doctor.

input: H I. i am 37 yo and i have had abdomanal pain in my right side for about three months now and the pain is really bad at night it wakes me up , it is like a bad stitch. i have my gallbladder removed about 10 mnths ago and i have a cycts on my left ovarie , my mother died from ovarian cancer and im a bit concerned
output: HI. When you are a diagnosed case of an ovarian cyst, this becomes the most probable reason in spite of the fact that you have pain on the right side of the abdomen and the ovarian cyst is on the left ovary. Other reasons of pain in right side like appendicitis, colitis, nephritis, lymph node mass, salpingitis and ovarian problem can be diagnosed on ultrasonography and be confirmed with CT scan. Once the probable diagnosis is made you can go for a diagnostic Laparoscopy and undergo definite surgery if need be, You can ask for the tumor marker tests since you have a history of cancer in the family.

output: Fullback pain and occasional blood in urine may be due to renal calculus, urinary tract infection etc. You need clinical correlation and investigations like routine hologram, renal function test, Urine RE/ME, Urine culture and sensitivity and Ultrasound of abdomen. Ultrasound is important, and it can exclude many possibilities. CT scan can be done if needed. Proper treatment depend upon findings. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor.

output: Hi...by what you quote this seems to be a nutritional anemia, but to be specific he needs to be investigated further. The test I recommend would be Hemoglobin electrophoresis, hemoglobin indices and serum folic acid and B12 levels. With so low hemoglobin (5.4g%), he might even require a blood transfusion. Once diagnosis of nutritional anemia is made it is treatable. Regards -

input: Hello, this is my question. I am a regular plasma donor at a facility here where I live. Every 4 months they take a blood sample to be sent off for a protein analysis, it usually takes 10 days to get the sample back. Normally I know when the sample will be taken so I take 10 days off from donating at all before and the sample always comes back fine (because I am older, 40, weight 153 and I  guess donating lowers my protein levels). I have had 2 samples come back recently with a protein of 5.9 (needs to be 6.0 or higher) and I am wondering what it is I need to be doing/and or changing to ensure that my levels are in range. Also, how is this different from the screening test they do every time I go in to donate to test my microhemocrotit? I have been out of range a couple times recently on that and was told to eat iron-rich foods. I am now including an iron supplement with my daily vitamins.

input: I took Cipro for UTI, and it came back a few days later, so I took it a second week. My symptoms were frequent need to urinate, even when there was hardly any liquid, and occasionally I would have blood on my panty liners, just a few drops, usually brought on by walking on a treadmill or moving around a lot. My need to urinate has improved, but still every 10-15 minutes when I get up, and about every hour after that. it is more frequent after I have had something to drink. I mostly drink water. I have a few drops of blood every day. I have no pain or burning, no fever. I am finishing up a candida supplement I have taken for 2 weeks.
output: I suggest you to have a cultural test of your purines: it is possible that you have an infection that is resistant to Ciprofloxacin, and with this exam you could have the possibility to know what bacterium is causing your infection and doing a specific antibiotic therapy. I also suggest you to check if the blood comes from purines or other part of your body.

Also, you will be checked to see the lump and confirm a diagnosis.

The thing is that the girl, brother suffers from vivid choreia on left side. What are we to expect if he really marries the girl?
output: DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your problem description. You have nothing to worry, I feel. Chorea is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, and is a neurological disorder. It shows genetic affiliation only with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that leads to toxic levels of copper in the body. You can have the girl checked for that. But it is better to give them permission if they are already determined. You cannot foresee what is going to happen in the future and therefore, don't try to foresee their future. That can cause unnecessary anxiety. They know how to live their life. Please understand. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: The night before last night I laid down on the floor and felt as if I had drank too much water. I then continued to go to bed, and once I laid down in bed, I noticed that my upper stomach (about and inch and a half above my bellybutton) was hurting. I then thought it might be indigestion, so I took tums. That didn t seem to help, and I couldn t fall asleep, so I took some advil, and that kind of helped. I was able to fall asleep. It did not wake me up at all in the night. I awoke to the same pain. This has lasted for almost two days now. This pain has also tended to move over to the right side of my stomach, just below my rib cage. I am wondering if this is appendicitis?
output: Here you have symptoms of pain in stomach from two days daily in night. The cause of this could be related to indigestion, acidity, or it can also be due to kidney stone as well appendicitis. I suggest visiting a doctor if it does not improve with anti acid and change with food habits and timing by keeping it proper as well healthy. Here doctor will ask you for ultrasound of abdomen after proper examination and I suggest going ahead for it for proper diagnosis and plan treatment as per that. Also keep your food habit regular and healthy. Have fruits also in diet. Keep doing daily morning and evening walking for 15-20 minutes. Do not have heavy dinner and keep dinner before 8:00pm daily. I have given here general guideline since the examination is not dine by me, but I am sure this will be useful if you follow it. Take care.

Because lung infection is very common in asthma patients. You are also having chest pain on coughing and breathing. This is known as pleurisy and pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy. So possibility of pneumonia is more. And pneumonia is infection, so it is definitely curable. You need broad spectrum antibiotics, antihistamines and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.

input: My daughter sears haven been pierced for 10+years. Today when she took one pair of earrings out her right ear hole for her earrings started to bleed but the other did not. What would cause it. She put another pair of earrings in her ears today and then tonight took them out and bleed again. We cleaned with wound cleaner and rubbing alcohol and then it stops. Very weird. Please advise any advice you may have.
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint bleeding from airhole can be due to infection in the area of ear-piercing while at times tightly packed earrings can lead to lack of air flow to the area of ear-piercing and can lead to inflammation and slight area of necrosis. I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving. You should wear earrings a bit loosely fastened so that air can flow easily. You should also wear gold or plastic earrings as they are inert materials and will not cause allergic reaction. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, after a clinical assessment of your abdomen and back along with a general physical examination, I would advise you for some routine blood tests like a CBC, blood sugar, serum amylase and lipase, an LFT, blood urea, serum creatinine, an ECG and some radiological investigation like an ultrasound of whole abdomen, X-ray chest and abdomen in upright posture, followed by a CT scan if need be.

Further management would depend on the result of clinical assessment and the investigation reports. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

input: My 4 year daughter stated she hit her head on the floor. I didnt see it but she has been complaining of a headache. Last night I gave her motrin and she went to bed. This morning she was ok but now she is complaining again and now she is sleeping (nap) which she NEVER does. Should I be worried?
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child. In case of trauma to head of child if their loss of consciousness, seizures, mouth or nose bleed or persistent vomiting, then there are chances of internal bleed or fracture. If these things are not present, then chances of internal bleeding are minimal. Pain at site of trauma may persist for few days. An examination by neurosurgeon is a must. I hope this will help you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.

I have hard masses on the bottoms of my feet (1 each) and on my shins (erythema nadosims - spelling incorrect). My Rheumatologist said that nothing was coming together for a diagnosis several years ago. Now within the last week I am losing strength in both my hands and the ability to grip objects small or large (been dropping things). My blood work showed high calcium levels, lymphs and wbc yet his nurse called me and said that doctor is on vacation but said to call me to say that the blood work looked good and that s it. I am VERY, VERY scared especially with whatever is happening to my hands!!! I have other things going on such as recent acid reflux, carpal tunnel, osteopinia, and knee issues that have me in physical therapy, not sure if they could all be related. Should I be getting a second opinion and be worried about whatever is happening with my hands?

Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiologist studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.

input: I have a smallish red spot on the right top edge of my penis head, as well as a blotchy red area on the dorsal side of the shaft, in the top area where I was circumcised. The spots/blotches are painless, do not itchy, and might be very slightly raised, but not very noticeably so. I currently am in a committed relationship and we do not use condoms, but neither of us have ever experienced any problems or concerns regarding STDs. I assume it is some kind of friction irritation, but am concerned it is something more serious.
output: HiT hank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query. Pain less spots can be STD like syphilis also. In such case dark field microscopy of swab from lesion helps to identify. A visual examination by a dermatovenerologist also helps. If it is that then antibiotics like doxycycline for 7 days will be helpful. If that is clear then ointments witChatDoctorbination of antifungal like fluconazole, antibacterial like Aureomycin and corticosteroid like dexamethasone will be helpful. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything is not clear. Thanks.

Back and shoulder pain, and shortness of breath is happening right now. I am Asthmatic, but I was wondering if I should try to get back on this medication?
output: The seizure medication shouldn't have anything to do with your current symptoms. Hopefully you had your shortness of breath checked out by your doctor. Back and shoulder pain, if you are still having it, could be further evaluated with MRI imaging and your doctors exam. If you are not having seizures, then there is no need to remain on the Levetiracetam.

input: my grandson 23 was in a car accident and suffered a concussion . He was in the hospital for an hour and sent home to be watched for 3 days. Two days later he set fire to his room and tried to kill himself. He is now in the hospital lock up room and hears voices. No alcohol or drugs in his system at either time. He has been depressed before all this happened and won t tell his parents why. Are the voices and attempted suicide from the accident alone?
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your question... Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression. When depression becomes severe, psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices, false beliefs, etc.) Moreover, since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident, it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage.  Depression can be caused due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain and need not be stress related always. So, it is not surprising that he did not reveal anything to his parents. With appropriate medication and close follow up he should be able to come out of his depression. Best wishes,-

Tata memorial hospital Mumbai is a research center, and they might have accurately done staging for your uncle. I guess the doctors want to shrink the tumor with chemotherapy and then proceed with surgery. The benefit in this situation is that the surgery is easy and there are better chances of survival. In many cancer hospitals the same protocol is used, and you might take another opinion at any well known cancer center. There is Kiddie memorial institute of oncology in Bangalore and cancer research center in Chennai and driven Chat Doctor.  Your uncle might take opinions at these centers before going for surgery. There is no single best doctor when we consider cancer treatment. It is an evolving field of medicine and I refer my patients to Tata memorial hospital because their set-up is organized and regularly new treatment options are reviewed for research purposes. Please do not worry.

input: A year ago, my young daughter (aged 6) made allegations against her father (my estranged partner) and another man who, she said, had been taking nude pictures of her. She doesn t remember being molested at all (and we don t know if she actually was) but at the time she was suffering recurrent bouts of thrush but since overnight contact stopped I have not had to go to the doctor once about this. She does have occasional redness and I m having to work on her hygiene in that area. I m told that thrush is a common problem in young girls and other medical professionals say it s not. I m confused - who is right, please?
output: Thrush can occur in pubertal girls more often than in very young child Chat Doctor.  That is the truth. Other than that, I was unable to understand the question. Why did you mention the first part of the question unless you suspected sexual abuse? In any case, treatment with local antifungal creams like clotrimazole is the only treatment available.

She can take nutritious diet including fruits, vegetables, cereals, eggs, milk, fish, meat etc. Taking small quantities of food at frequent intervals is beneficial. For more details you can ask me directly through the premium forum. Take care.

And you're all symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, giddiness, dizziness etc. on strenuous work are seen commonly in cardiac disease. So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal than get done chest x-ray and PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to rule out respiratory cause for your symptoms. If this is also normal than got done CBC (Complete Blood Count) to rule out anemia as anemia can also cause similar symptoms.

input: I am 46 years old and looking for a solution to a life long problem I have with purple mottled legs  this condition gets worse when it is cold.  I also have a problem with Reynauds disease.  is there any herbal remadies I can take?  is it an auto immune disorder?  Is is connective tissue illness and if so what do i take.  i suffered from recurrent miscarriages betweeen my two children.
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A history of purple mottled legs and worsening of condition when exposed to cold is suggestive of Reynolds disease. Raynauds disease is an autoimmune disease and is treated with steroids. The disease runs a chronic course with waxing and waning course. Steroids have to be taken as the disease flares up or relapses. Episodes have to be controlled with Chat Doctor. The effect of herbal medications is questionable. You need to stay in contact with your rheumatologist. The recurrent miscarriages appear to be unrelated to the Reynolds disease. Thanks and take care

input: I have been married since 7yrs n no baby yet..m suffering from  PCOD n weight is 95kg.I have went to so many many doctors all r saying reduce ur weight first, bcoz of which I be depressed most of the time .. I tried so many medicines,diets,excercises but no result..Now my new doc has said tht IUI will work for me..I require guidance please help.
output: Hi, Thanks for the query. Weight reduction means, there is no need of Chat Doctor.  Reduction of 1 to 2 kg scan also help in regularization of the cycles. Then you can gradually decrease the weight. To do GUI also, you have to ovulate. In GUI during the time of ovulation, your husbands' semen will be injected into your uterus. So for that also ovulation is needed. If your doctor suggests you can go for ovulation induction. Then plan for follicular study to track the ovulation. And you can plan GUI at that time with your doctors' advice. Take care.

input: Hi My Name is Stephanie. I was biten by a copperhead snake on 7-6-14 around 10pm. I was taken to the ER and givin 4 viles of antivenom. I stayed in the hospital until 7-10-14. So I ve been home 5 days and the swelling has not gone done, it itches and sore to the touch. Should i go have it looked at now or wait.
output: Hello, Thanks for your query. I am happy to help you here. Today is 22nd of July. If you have swelling till today, then it's better to have a follow-up. Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER. At the time being I recommend you to take antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication to prevent infection, decrease itching and to decrease the swelling. For now, I suggest you to either have a follow-up or you can take some medications as bellow. Chymoral forte once died before food for 1 wk (it will help to decrease swelling)Tab Exocet 5 mg 1 at night before sleep for 3 days (to decrease itching)Tab metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for 5 days. Tab definite 200 mg twice daily for 3 days. I hope my talk would be helpful. Will be happy to help you father. Thank you.

Also creating and bun elevate..... Worried this is something serious... Referred to a hematologist.. What tests will they order?
output: Your white blood cell count is slightly low (4.00-is lower limit of normal range for an adult). Your platelet counts are almost normal - so nothing to worry about your platelets. 14% monocytes are on higher side though.

output: Hello, I have studied your case and I do not think that you can have a broken blood vessel in your arm. You may be having hematoma due to collection of blood in skin or subcutaneous tissue. You need to apply hot water fomentation, compression bandage and take govern tablet twice daily. If there is no decrease in size of the swelling then you can get a physician opinion. But I can assure you that it is not a broken vessel.

input: My 6 year old daughters pediatrician is sending us to an endocrinologist for Clatorial Hypertrophy. When looking up research on this I am not finding to much to explain what it is or how serious it is. I would like to know what it means without all the medical terms getting in the way of understanding it.
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Clitoris is a part of female genitals which is a regressed meaning shrunken form of male penis ( male sexual organ). Its normally seen as a small bud like thing in the upper part of female vagina. In some abnormal situation, it enlarges(hypertrophy) and looks very prominent then it's called clitoral hypertrophy.

I really got scared i told him what he had done and that if he had realised what he has done. his response was yes . he then got out of bed and went to the toilet. At this point he really sh?? me up.That evening he was watching a vampire movie with lots of blood and guts. He does not sleep well. His bedtime routine is sleeping between 1am and 3am. He gets up for half 8pm. He s got a lot of stress . He speaks jiberish whiles sleeping and makes sudden movements. Once he was having a nightmare until I woke I m up, asking him if he was ok. I think I saved him from his nightmare. Can you please help and give some sort of explanation. Thanks kera
output: Hello Seethalkaursingh, The problem you have tried to describe, doesn't appear to a nightmare. Its closer to being a night terror. Please understand that sucChatDoctorplains are very common and increase at the time of stress. People generally don't discuss them as they don't cause any problem for themselves. Epilepsy / seizure disorder is another concern, and he should be investigated by an EEG.  There are many unanswered questions in your write-up. But one thing is for certain that your husband surely need some help from a psychiatrist. Please ask him to visit one who would like to explore many his areas.

input: I went into the hospital 3 weeks ago with gallstones and they had to put me on a potassium drip for 4 days to get my potassium levels back up. (6 bags total) My liver enzymes and heart enzymes were high but I tested negative for every test they gave me including all hepatitis. Now, it has dropped again, what could be causing it to drop?
output: Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for posting your query. Let me make it clear about uses of potassium in the body. It helps in functioning of muscle and nerve cells in the body.

input: Hi! I tripped & fell on 1/25/14 & of course my hand was bruised & extremely swollen, limited ROM. I had it in a thumb spica splint for a 1 1/2 wks til I could get an apt to see a hand specialist 2/5. They put it in a cast for a month & took it off on 3/5. When they removed it my thumb was extremely stiff & painful, could barely move it. I ve been having hand therapy twice a week & my ROM has improved drastically. The only problem is that the MRI I had on 3/18 showed I had a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament. The Dr says that I m stable & surgery doesn t look needed & I can go to work in 2 wks if I feel ok (I m a RN). What do you think of his decision? They re going to make me a thermoplastic splint to wear as needed. Right now I take off the regular big thumb spica splint off about 6 times a day. I do the heated rice, picking up marbles, & ROM exercises, ice, etc. The pain is minimal 2-4 / 10 (used to be 6-7 / 10 in beginning). So, is surgery always indicated with a complete tear? Or if you re progressing, is it possible to not have any surgery & make a full recovery? I m concerned b/c I m a nurse & my hands are my life. Been outta work for 2 months now & missing it, but also don t wanna come back too soon as I m still having some pain & stiffness. I still can t bend it all the way down, & my strength is only 1/2 my right hand per PT (I m right handed & my left thumb is where the injury is). So what would be your next step or what do you think about my situation? And fortunately none of the XRays show any fractures, but I m feeling the ligament is a lot worse injury.
output: HiThe the best assessment is if ROM is improved and no movement problems for routine work, nothing needs to be done.the dear tissue healing may have occurred by now...synthetic repair not of much value if you already don't feel incapacitated

input: I ve been told I need carpal tunnel surgery in both hands, (had the EMG test yesterday). I will see my doc next week for the next steps.

input: Four days ago, i was swimming at the beach and a wave pushed me and I twisted my knee. I have put ice packs, knee brace and tried to stay off my foot as much as possible. My knee never swelled. It is only painful when I sit too long or have to move to get up. Please advise.
output: Hello, As you were pushed by the wave and twisted the knee joint, with the history it sounds to be a ligament sprain. Due to which you are facing difficulty in getting pain while performing knee movement.  Kindly do hot water fermentation and allow the limb to rest. Use knee brace for 3 weeks or so. Then do simple knee exercises like static Qua Chat Doctor.  You should be fine. As you applied to ice there won't be swelling. So in any injury icing is advised to avoid swelling as it will lead to vasoconstriction of blood capillaries. So you don't have swelling.  Usually, icing is advised if we are planning for some x-ray or MRI. Do the conservative therapy mentioned above, and you should be fine. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In

input: hi!!! my age is 23(Unmarried) i m facing irregular periods from the day of my maturity. i have consulted doctor they adviced me to take CYCLOREG.. from past one year if i would not consume tablet also my periods were regular. but, again now from past two months it is the same. so can u please suggest me weather this leads to infertility?? consuming tablet is good or bad?
output: Irregular periods mean you are suffering from poly cystic ovarian disease or pod. Cycloreg leads to medicinal stimulation of the ovaries and in turn regularizing your cycles. The effect of the medicine can continue for some time even after discontinuation. In the longer run people with pod have problems conceiving and should plan an early pregnancy. Cycloreg will have to be stopped when planning for pregnancy as it is an oral contraceptive pill, and you cannot conceive when on this. Sadly, this is the only treatment for pod. Diet control and weight loss can help relieve the symptoms of pod.

input: my sister has been battling cancer.  First she had cervical cancer.  She had radiation and surgery and was in the clear.  months later the cancer had metastisized into 3 masses in her lower body near the site of the original tumor.  chemotherapy has proven ineffective.  the doctors have basically said there is nothing they can do.  they have stopped chemo and now have her on a drug to stop blood flow to the tumors to help prolong her life.  I have read that thioredoxin protects the cancer cells from chemotherapy and radiation.  I have also read some publications about thioredoxin reductase as a cancer treatment.  do you have any information on this subject and can you suggest any clinics specializing in thioredoxin reductase.  I have also read there is a link to the gene p53 as a tumor suppressor.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Research shows that redox-sensitive signaling factors such as thioredoxin reductase-1 (TR) and thioredoxin (TRX) may represent central pro-survival factors that would allow tumor cells to evade the damaging and potentially cytotoxic effects of endogenous and exogenous agents that induce oxidative stress. There have been clinical trials which have shown that thioredoxin reductase inhibitors like arsenic trioxide might have role in treatment of cancer. It is important to know your location so that we might suggest you a hospital where this treatment is provided. Please contact your national cancer network as they might have details. Please do not worry.

input: hey my name is aya, i live in the states, i have more than a question, my mother had been having frequent heart pulpitations from time to time and she started to high blood sugar since my grandfather died, she had been under medication for 9 months now for her blood sugar but she stopped it because it became normal and 2 days ago she started to have high blood sugar like its level is 210 which is high for her, so what can she do ? and what does it mean to have frequent pulpitations?
output: Hello, I understand your concern and would explain that the palpitations could be related to possible cardiac arrhythmia.  For this reason, I recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring for possible cardiac arrhythmia and some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible imbalance).  Regarding her glucose levels, she may have diabetes. For this reason, I would recommend performing HbA1C levels to check for diabetes.

output: Hi and thank you for asking! I read your query very carefully. You are having chest discomfort (twinges on your chest) for a few weeks now, which may be a sign for new onset chest angina. New onset angina may be a warning sign for future cardiovascular events including heart attack. This is why its essential that you contact a cardiologist for further examinations. You shouldn't wait for the cardiologist appointment and go to ER if your symptoms increase in intensity or become more frequent (signs that the things are getting worse).Otherwise, you should wait for cardiologist appointment. Meantime, wish you health!

I ve been feeling really gassy and bloated since the IUI and have had cramps on and off the whole time. If I was pregnant wouldn t it have shown on the test I did today?
output: HelloThanks for your query. Ideally you should wait a couple of days after your expected date of period to take a urine home pregnancy test. If it is negative, odds are very low that you are pregnant. However, consult your treating doctor, and go for an ultrasound or blood test to confirm. All the best.

I keep trying to tell myself its just stress and for the most part Ive ingnored it, Im just a little concerned because none of the symptoms have gone away.

Get it done from reputed laboratory.  If reports are normal diagnosis is anxiety disorder. If reports are showing high sugar levels its diabetes Mellitus. For DM YOU NEED TO consult diabetiologist.  If you are having excessive stress and anxiety in life try meditation and yoga which are very helpful. All the best.

input: Hi, I am having terrible upper abdominal pain. My current MD is unable to diagnose the problem. I have had a lot lab work as well as CT scan and ultrasound. So far I have been told that everything is normal. But everything is not normal - no one seems to believe me or able to Diagnose the problem. I have pain everyday some days so bad that I cant work - that s a problem. I have a PMD as well as a GI doctor and still no answers. Any suggestions?
output: Hello and welcome. I think that you should do endoscopy to diagnose it since CT scan will not be able to detect intraluminal pathology such as ulcer or polyp. Also, it may be caused by inflammatory bowel diseases, and you need to see intervention gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Regards

input: I m a 5 10 female, 25 years old, 122 pounds. I have been feeling a dull and often pinching pain on my right lower abdomen. It presents a small bulge, that I can t push in. Went to 4 surgeons and they don t think its a hernia, but from a bike fall that I had 6 months ago (I did 3 MRIs and 3 ultra sounds, and nothing showed). It really hurts when I am sitting for too long, and I feel discomfort like something is pressuring my abdominal wall. Please help.
output: Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the Chat Doctor. As you have already been examined clinically and a thorough imaging was performed, my understanding is you may not have any visceral problem. Your doctors have also ruled out body wall defect like hernia.in some cases, fibromyalgia may produce similar symptoms in the absence of an organic disease. Therefore, you should also consult a psychiatrist to evaluate for fibromyalgia. You should also be clinically examined by a second doctor (should be a general surgeon) to rule out any abnormality. For any further information, please write back to me directly or tag me in your question.  

input: My 6 year old son has been ill for over a week now with headaches, and lumps on the back of his head. Been to A&E and was told it was swollen glands and was given calpol. A few days later he was still very poorly and lumps had got bigger. Went to my GP who said it is a scalp infection and gave antibiotics and antihistamine. Finished course of medicine and lumps are still present and sore! What do i do next!!?
output: HI, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I studied your query. I understood Your health concerns. Based on the facts of your query, you seem to suffer from-Boil with lymphadenitis, with resolved nodes after antibiotics. Remaining lumps indicates Chronic Amenities with fibrotic changes in it. Reason of antibiotics not giving regression of these lumps is due to the accompanied Chronic fur uncle- lumps with its lymphadenitis.FNAC biopsy / or Excision Biopsy / or CT study -of the persistent lumps, would give the exact cause of these persistent/ non-regressive lumps. Other causes like infectious mono, or viral lymphadenitis/or TB lymphadenitis/ NHL/HL lymphoma-needs to be ruled out. As the facts are very scanty, I would also suggest you to take Second opinion from Surgeon, to rule out other causes which would cause such symptom/complaints, after physical/clinical examination. Will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at Chat Doctor. Good Day!!  Chat Doctor. S. Genl-CVTS

I am so allergic to antibiotics. I have had nuclear heart stress test-cat scan-found small kidney stone-gaul bladder-pancreas liver ultrasound Kidney ultra sound all negative. I have had very little blood when kidney infection, never had that before. All cleared up with antibiotics. My Dr. wanted me to take pepto bismol 4 times a day for H.Pylori. Because he prescribed amoxicillin which I am allegic to. So upset. He never gave me an alternative now. I am positive and need to clear this up. I went on line and saw someone with same problem Biaxin-Tetracycline and Acipex. I am going tomorrow to new Dr. Hoping they will give me this. My regular blood work was fine.Perfect dne in May. I only take Losartan 50mg. Been in excellant health till this. It comes on suddenly especially in the morning.

input: I am a 30 yr old female that has been experiencing an irregular heart beat brought on by possible stress of starting a new position at work. Ever since I atarted it my heart has had random episodes of quick beats to where it feels like two at a time .. Its noticeable and im wondering whats wrong. No change if anything other than my job.
output: Hi, two beats which you feel in succession may be because of extra beats, the change in job and early anxiety about fitting in new place may increase the stress hormones like a Chat Doctor.  Both the situation is completely benign and just some relaxation techniques would help. If it's too troublesome a 24 hour holder would be the best test to evaluate the same or and EKG during the episode. Also, for your age rule out thyroid as the cause if associated symptoms are present. Regards 

input: My sons skull seems to have a more prominent ridge over his right ear than the left (if you were to touch his ear at the top to his skull...just above that). It almost looks like an egg but it seems like part of the structure of his skull. I have noticed it for awhile but it seems a little more prominent now than before. He does not have a misshapen head in any other way and it feels like its symmetrical with the other side except its a little larger on that side. Should I be concerned?
output: As long as there are no symptoms or signs of brain and cognitive dysfunction then there is no need to worry at all.this could be just normal skull shape and nothing to worry.

input: Can hyperinflated lungs be normal? I got my x-ray result :Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD, no other any medical  problem concert. I have never had  any illness. I had x-ray last year that result is normal. The doctor said I may can not work in a nursing home.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern.

input: Dear DoctorMy mum has congestive heart failure and has been taking as a diuretic Frusemide 40mg daily.  Just recently the nurse at the heart failure clinic added in Spironolactone 12.5mg daily but the Frusemide dose is the same.  Is it normal that 2 different diuretics are prescribed to be taken concurrently and also will this have any reaction with the Candesartan that she takes as well? How often must her urea & electrolyte levels be checked now?Thankyou for your help.
output: Hi, If your mother doesn't have kidney failure, it is a good idea to prescribe Spironolactone and Furosemide together. Spironolactone will not let to a big Chat Doctor.

Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: I just found out a blackish red swelling (much like an insect bite) on my lower back just beside the spine. It itches a little, but it cannot be an insect bite since I was wearing warm clothes through out the day and noticed it when I removed my clothes. The same thing happened a month or so ago and went away after I took levocetrizine and applied some soframycine ointment. I want to know if this might be an indication of something serious.

output: Hello, As you are able to do daily activities, so it is clear that you don't have a bony injury.-Hip joint-Knee joint-Ankle jointThese are the whole body weight-bearing joints, So minor injury or major injury to these joints shouldn't be neglected, and the patient needs absolute bed rest. In your case, it's not a fracture of bone but soft tissue injury (Mostly spring ligament or bursitis). So there should be absolute bed rest with crêpe bandage application. Please see an Orthopaedician for how to apply the bandage. Take good analgesics like tablet Stretford twice daily for five days. Take tablet Circa Once daily for three weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: both my arms are aching from the shoulders down, I struggle to lift a cup of coffee due to the pain. I thought it may be due to the way I sleep which is on either side and I bend my arm and place under my pillow. what do you think may be causing this?
output: Hellhole this may be a problem with the shoulders themselves, like bursitis or rotator cuff tendonitis, the more likely problem is either spinal stenosis or a disc problem in your neck need to see a doctor for this, and I would get MRI scans of both shoulders and of your cervical spine to determine exactly what the problem is.

input: Hi Dr. ChandanI am familiar with the anatomy of the penis, and it seems I have dilated lymphatic channels under the skin of my glans penis.  They become more prominent when I get an erection.  Any idea what this could be?  These vessels were preceded by a fluid filled vesicle I had years ago which I popped
output: HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorYou wrongly understood it the lymphatic system neither dilate nor constrict, this is only possible with the vascular system, if you do not have any clinical sign and symptoms then why to have such weird kind of thinking, I hope this information helps you take care and have good day.

input: i undergone pneumonia treatment in hospital for 3 days by taking antibiotics (IV). After discharge i am getting more back pain and chest tighten pain. If I use hifenac-mr it is giving immediate relief, can i continue it, if so please give dosage. i am 36 old and female
output: Dear patient It seems you have got back stiffness due to rest. Since you were under treatment for pneumonia in hospital you must be on rest which might lead to muscle stiffness and pain. You need physiotherapy with back extension and back strengthening exercises and do hot water fomentation for your back. If you are feeling better with higher Mr you can continue it. Dosage is twice a day for 5 days. All the best

input: Hello Doctor, This is Sonaliee. I m from India Bangalore, but now I have come to London for the last 2 months. I m married for almost 1 1/2 year. My husband and me have been desperately trying for a child, but in vain. In 2008, I was hospitalized for food poison and the doctor told me to take a scan, only then did the doctor say that I have PCOS. The doctor suggested me to meet a gynecologist. I immediately met Dr Shanta, who is a gynecologist in Chennai (My aunt s friend), She explained what PCOS is and started off with my treatment immediately, She gave me MEPRATE & GLYSOFATE (I m not too sure about the spelling) and she told me to do a lot of exercise and walking as my weight was 72 kgs then and my age was 28. Till then my cycles were regular I got married in December 2008, I did not get my periods at all that month. I got it on 14th Jan 2009, My first cycle after marriage, And I had terrible stomach pain. So my husband s granny gave me some herbal leaves to take to avoid this stomach pain, It was a normal cycle for 5 days, and I took this herbal leaves only for the first 3 days. Again I did not get my cycle in the month of February. I was wondering what could be wrong with me, So i told my husband that we need to see a Gyno, In the mean time I had also told what Dr Shanta had told about PCOS. So we went to Apollo Dignostic and got a complete master health check up done for my husband and me. After the reports came the doctor said that my husband is in the initial stage of Diabetes. As the sugar level was high, his urine & semen report was also not proper, We were asked to meet the Sr. Doctor in the same hospital. We had to again explain everything to that doctor, and also told her about my irregular cycles. She suggested that she does not handle all this as she is just a general physician so she suggested us to go to ANKUR FERTILITY and get a semen analysis done, I suggested my husband that we shall go to Dr Shanta itself but since we came to know that he has diabetic now and we were married for only 3 months then and Dr shanta is a very good friend of my aunt so he was not willing to come there. We had no choice but to go to ANKUR, we got the semen analysis done and the doctor said that his sperm count is very less. Then they told us about the treatment, that I need to get treated for my cycles to get regular and my husband for his sperm count to increase, Then the doctor told she has to do a IVF for us. For which my husband was not OK with it. His sugar level started increasing more and every times when ever we used to have an intercourse I used to have infection, Even he was undergoing terrible pain, We stopped going even to ANKUR, We were going to a local nursing house in our area, and that doctor had give heavy dose, so there was bleeding in his penis, then that doctor told my husband to do a circumsection. Then we took a second option from a doctor who is a Sr Doctor in Diabetes and that doctor told us not to get into all this, she prescribed GLOCONORM - G for my husband by the time all this happened it was in the month of September, In October my husband flew to London as he got his job here. Even I started taking treatment from Dr Kamalini who is a mother and child care specialist in a nursing home near my house and she prescribed for me FOLININE, CHROMINA - A (1) EVERDAY, ROSINORM - M (1-0-1) EVERDAY for PCOS, and to get my cycles regular DUPHASTON for 5 days. Now I have been taking this tablets from the month of November till date. I came to London 2 months back now my husbands sugar has come to normal it is 80 - 90 before fast and 110 - 120 after fast and after 1 month of intercourse my husband and me checked in the pregnancy kit, but still it is showing negative, We are very very disappointed and upset with this, and because of this now and then we are having small fights at home. Everybody has now started questioning me why still I m unable to get pregnant. Which make me feel very unsecured. Doctor can you please help me out with this, Is there any chance that I can get pregnant soon. I m very desperate and have lost my patience now, cause my friends who were married after me have conceived by now and are in their 4 month and 5 month, and I m feeling so bad that I m still not able to and even my age is passing, Please suggest me how do I get pregnant soon and come out of it. My email id is YYYY@YYYY , in case if you want to send any mails, please do. It will be very very great full if you can help me out with this. Thank you - Sonaliee.

input: Hi Can you help? I have a pain in my top front tooth , I went to a dentist two years ago and he said i need a small filling in this tooth and from then on I have had pain. I have been back five times to him also another two dentists and I am told there is nothing wrong. My mother passed away at the time I had the filling so one dentist said it was stress .
output: Hi, if the filling was done without a proper cavity preparation, which could be by two ways-one, if the carious structure was not cleaned up properly, it leads to caries spreading underneath. Secondly if there is pulp exposure while deep cavity preparation, it leads to persistent pain after the filling. Please take a ray and go for a root canal treatment to get rid of the pain.  You may need a crown also if there is discoloration. Take care!

input: Hello Chetna, I am Megha (age 28yrs). I had miscarriage thrice earlier within 1-1.5months of preg. This time, I have been lucky and I am 11weeks pregnant now. My Doc has asked me to use corion 5000 from past 1.5 months and for another 2 weeks(once in 4 days) Also Sugest 200mg, thrice a day, and Glycomet 500SR once a day. Now recently doc asked me to use Duvadilan Retard 40mg as well (twice a day) I had 2 Ultra Scans till now and it was normal. Now the next scan is on 1st feb, based on the results my Doc would provide the medication. My query is: Is it normal to use all the above mentioned medicines..are there any side effects on the baby....expecting your response, thanks a lot (0000)
output: Hello Ms. Mega, All these medications have been used during pregnancy with no reported untoward effects. In view of your past obstetric history, your doctor has prescribed chorionic gonadotropin injections to help sustain the pregnancy until the placenta takes over the function of hormone production. This is why progesterone supplementation also is being used. Metformin is prescribed when insulin resistance is seen as in POD to prevent abortions and gestational diabetes. Nevadian is a uterine muscle relaxant. Please do not worry, you are on the right track. Take care.

input: I have recently noticed that when I am concentrating, I stick out my tongue about a half inch between my lips. This is very disturbing because my mom, now 84 yrs, has always done that, but in the last 10 years, its gotten worse and when she concentrates on anything, her tongue is often sticking out by its entire length and looks creepy. I dont want to get like that. I am a very healthy 58 year old runner and triathlete.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. There is nothing wrong in that. Everyone has some mannerisms. When we overly indulge ourselves in some task, these mannerisms surface automatically. This happens just because we were never aware of it and never tried to overcome it. Here, you want to overcome it just because you do not want it to happen. Fine. The negative feeling about it itself is enough to stop it. Still as an enhancing step, Just put some chewing gum inside your mouth whenever you are doing something. Also, good for your mouth and teeth. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: my wife has lupus and is in extreme pain. she stopped one med because it was causing eye damage and she cant take the other one the doctor recommended because it causes osteoperosis (she is borderline already). we are becoming desperate, so i remembered i had an old prescription of Naproxen. she took a 500 mg and it really helped her - for most of the day. is this something we should ask the doctor to prescribe? she has been to numerous doctors numerous time since being diagnosed one year ago, and none of them have mentioned Naproxen.
output: Sir the pain in lupus may be due to involvement of joint in the form of arthritis and muscle causing myalgic.Also, there may be associated fibromyalgia as well. For treatment of the same Naproxen may be given for few days to decrease inflammation and hence relief in pain, but it would never cure the root cause of the disease which depends on some immunological markers. Some general measures like use of hot moist towel, sauna bath, hot shower, regular yoga exercises with mediation would be of great help in long term improvement of pain

input: Have been experiencing some lingering symptoms that i would want to attribute to Candida or acute parasitic infection(protozoa). The symptoms are as follows: Weird bodily sensations that can be itchy, motile, slight spasms, back ache( especially in d mornings), erectile dysfunction( i do have an erection as when due but dont think i retain as long as i should), mental fogginess, digestive discomfort etc Whats your prognosis doc?
output: Hi, For erectile dysfunction- get relaxed. Avoid stress and stop smoking and alcohol. Try keel exercise. Do NOT take any medicine without consulting the doctor. Get examined by doctor and do the tests as It's important to find out the cause. Take medicines only after having seen by the doctor. The problem can be related to stress, but can sometimes be because of diabetes, heart disease, hormonal problem etc. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Cellophane You for contacting Chat Doctor. Such symptoms appear because of allergy to some specific thing. You need to observe that what particular food causes swelling after you eat.

Research has shown that it decreases the allergic symptoms considerably. Hope this answers your question.

output: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion iron supplements are known to cause constipation or hard stools. Constipation is routinely seen complaint in pregnancy. To prevent the constipation:-1) Change the iron preparation- Certain iron preparations tend to cause gastritis, constipation etc. So changing the brand might be tried.2)Take adequate fluids up to 3 liters per day.3)Take high fiber diet daily.4)Take laxatives if needed. Nothing to worry. It will subside by following the above measures. Coming to vaginal lips swelling check for any infection like white discharge or itching or any high BP. The swelling can also be related to excessive straining at stools. If everything is normal the swelling might be considered physiological as some swelling of vaginal lips might be there in pregnancy and subsides after delivery. But iron preparations might not be associated with swelling of vaginal lips. Anyways nothing to worry as such. Prevention of constipation is important to avoid other problems. Hope this helps. Best regards....

There is a possibility of conception this time, if you had sex around 11th to 15th July.  Actually POD is characterized by slow, irregular or no ovulation. Still you do have a chance to conceive-there are medicines to correct the problem. So don't worry. Consult a sync for proper investigations treatment.  Thanks.

input: I have a pituitary tumor 9cm x 5.4cm x 6.2cm ... I was given 1 year to live since March 21 2012... I am a 47yr old male aprox 6 tall at 215 lbs... I am VERY active with a strong belief in Jesus !... I have been in a debate then an argument with my dr. because he was making judgments of my health without test or proof !!!... He told the DMV I am having seizures and took my drivers license without 1 (one) EEG test ???... Now with a little bet more background,,, I had 2 previous surgeries (1 in 2003 and 1 in 2007) through my upper lip and into my nasal cavity ... those tumors were up to 4.5cm x 5.5 cm and were removed only at 80% due to them being too close to my eyes and brain stem... but when this new tumor was diagnosed, they wanted to remove my forehead ???? OUCH !!!!!... I was NOT willing to go through such a risky surgical procedure, so I was given the choice to take cabergoline 0.5 (2 pills a day twice a week = 4 pills a week).... NOW, I had an EEG and I was diagnosed in Good health (No Seizures!).... I am getting my license back, I am still very active and (so far...) And... I am NOT DEAD ! Based on your experience, 1st, have you heard such a Crazy story... 2nd, Am I going to Die ?... Last, why would ANY Dr. take my license without EVER giving me a test to prove I am having seizures ???

input: Hi, they put me on cephalexin for infection that I have above my lip, got put on it yesterday 3 times a day and its 500 mg. When will i see results? And its still swollen and red in one area.And is ok to swollow the pill I hope cause they did not say like one of the pages that you should not so I hope thats ok. They said they are not sure what happen  and I think maybe I got bitten or something cause there was a mark there and know like I said still a mark but red around it and I was running a temp also of 100
output: Hi. Thanks for the query. As per your symptoms of having a red and swollen area above the upper lip and having raised body temperature can be either due to allergic reaction to any bee sting or can be due to infection like Hair follicle infection. As you are being treated with Cephalexin that is an antibiotic, and you have taken 3 doses without any side effects you can continue taking the antibiotic for the prescribed time period by your physician. You can also take Acetaminophen or Tylenol for reducing body temperature. Topical application of steroid ointment can help in reducing inflammation and discomfort. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: I have been using ring guard cream for 18 days. The infection got a little better but after 2 days red spots began to appear on the infection area. So i stopped using the ring guard. So what to do now? The skin infection is still there and severe. Its on the neck and above the thigh area.
output: Hi!! According to your history it seems to be a case of ringworm infection as initially you had improvement in your skin lesion after applying ring guard. I would recommend you to take oral terminating 250 mg once daily and apply terminating cream over the affected area twice daily.

Besides this don't share your soap and towel, stay in a cool and airy environment and wear loose cotton clothes. Hope for your speedy recovery.

input: my father has been going down hill health wise for the last 6 mths maybe even the last year . we took him to the hospital this last time and with in 24 hours they said he had a streap in his bloodstream and it has caused heart valve damage . what I want to know is this an infection that he had for a while or is this something that can happen in 24 hours . I just think it would take time for this to happen to the heart and being that he has be declining for a time now could he have before we took him to the hospital?
output: Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor. Blood is usually sterile I.e. devoid of any bacteria or viruses. Bacteria or viruses can appear in blood after a throat infection, urine infection or lung infection. Once the bacteria enter the blood they can infect other organs including the heart. The bacteria settle on the valves of the heart and cause infection and destruction of the valves. This happens over time and cannot happen in 24 hrs. But he must have had symptoms like fever, breathlessness, shivering etc. You have not mentioned any of the symptoms. Here. The treatment of infective endocarditis is long term treatment with antibiotics and some residual damage to valve always remains. Wishing him good health Regards

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Neck pain and swollen glands in neck in chronic smoker can be due to either infection or cancer.

input: Hi, I have a mass at the top of my left inner thigh which extends to my right hip bone. A biopsy said, no cancer. Doctors at U.C.L.A. don t seem to know why it s there . It s deep behind the groin and they re not sure what to do about it. The biopsy technician only took a half inch of fluid in a tube, The fluid was on the outside of the mass. Would that have shown that the mass itself was non-canceous, and I don t know why he didn t take any of the mass itself. Do you know the answer to that and also what it might be? Thanks. Barbara
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It may be that mass is a cyst such as simple bone cyst and aneurysm bone cyst. Probably he was not able to get solid tissue. If tissue is proper then if biopsy shows no cancer, then it is OK. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you a good health. Take care.

output: Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, if this is just symptoms of nausea and vomiting then it could be due to gastritis dyspepsia, and it may not be pancreatic disease only if the symptoms persist for long time and associated some other symptoms then it requires the lab and imaging work up for correct diagnosis hope this information helps.

input: hello doctor, i am 20 weeks pregnant and my scan report shows the followingA single, live, intra uterine fetus is seen exhibiting active movementsplacenta; posterior       maturity grade.  1amniotic fluid: adequateheart;150 bpmBpd: 42mmAC: 130 mmFL :28 mmestimated gestational age: 18 w 6 daysestimated fetal weight: 0256 gmsis there  any  problems in this report  and what about the growth ?  it is 1 week lowe than the actual
output: Hi there,This is an absolutely normal findings of ultrasound scan at 20 weeks. The measurements give an estimate of weeks but, a variability from the actually calculated date can be present, as ultrasound only gives a rough estimate. So in effect the ultrasound findings can be plus or minus 1 week in first trimester; 2 weeks in second trimester; and more than two weeks in third. This variability is decreased with newer machines but can't be totally removed. So I would say that this report is absolutely reassuring, and you should not worry at all. A good fetal heart rate and a placenta which is only grade 1 maturity indicates that everything is as it should be at this stage. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.

output: HelloElevated SGPT and GOT may indicate liver injury. It may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. You may need few more investigations like routine hologram, complete liver function test, random blood sugar, lipid profile, viral markers, urine RE/ME, ultrasound of abdomen. I suggest tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg tablet twice daily for three months. It helps in regeneration of liver cells. You may need to take few more medicines after complete investigations. Try to avoid saturated fat. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor.

output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thanks for the query. It is hard to say, but it may indicate any urinary infection or std.Also, dark urine may be sign of bilirubin elevation, so you should check your liver tests.

input: I ve been experiencing bouts of severe abdominal pain over the past 7 months and admitted to the hospital four times. I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , irritable bowel , typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2 , 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008). My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, heart palpitations, tightness in my chest, headaches, sweats, pains in the left arm, lightheaded/dizziness. Tests showed a normal EKG, but some tachycardia. The EGD showed a hiatal hernia and a growth that was sent out for a biopsy. Lab reports showed among other things, anemia. The ct scan showed typhlitis , whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed stenotic ileocecal valve. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is. Here are the majority of the pieces of the puzzle, any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated.
output: Hi MEANS, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! Your problem is really very complex. So many possible causes are there. Two of your medicines need to be switched, Singular needs to be stopped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective, You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100 mg thrice a day after meals, which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain, that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon, and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get baseline investigations like Chest X-Ray, Electrocardiogram, Complete Blood Counts, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Fasting and Postprandial Blood Sugar, Thyroid Profile, Lipid Profile, Ultrasound Abdomen, Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem, so a definite treatment could be started.  I hope this advice would be helpful for you.

He maintained stability til 2011. He went through chemo for over a year and when that stopped working he was given another full course of radiation. Though there were side effects he had been doing fairly stable since the radiation ended. On Tuesday morning he awoke fairly normally, but after a few hours he was suddenly much worse. He could barely speak, kind of like Charlie Brown s teacher. We felt the right side of his face was slightly slack. His ability to walk or move his right hand was bad also. I thought it might have been a stroke . He refused to go to the Doctor. The question I have has to do with one of his other symptoms. Monday night he complained of pain running from the edge of his left breast under his arm toward the back. Since Tuesday when he has this pain his breathing gets really odd. It isn t really shortness of breath as much as breathing with a continual hitch in it. It is sort of shallow, but it is more like hiccup breathing without the hiccups. Since I can not convince him to go to the Doctor this is kind of an academic question. But can the pain in his side and breathing problem be a sign of a stroke also? And if all of this does point to a stroke, which type would it point ?
output: Hi, The symptoms match clinically with stroke. Right sided weakness, respiratory problem can be caused by cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Left sided chest pain mainly radiating to back can be caused by cardiac pathology. Anyway, a brain imaging like CT scan and EKG will be helpful. You should immediately consult with a physician. Take care.

input: I have a hole in the bottom of my mouth near the front very tiny hole but painful ... however my daughter and I were playing and her nail did hurt the inside of my mouth ... this has happened before but never for this long without going to the dentist what can I do?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to traumatic injury caused by nail there has been torn of mucosa leading to formation of a painful traumatic ulcer. Due to inflammation there is pain. I would suggest you to start applying a numbing gel containing Lidocaine or Choline Salicylate to relieve pain. You can apply steroid ointment containing Escort or Triamcinolone Acetone to reduce inflammation. You can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen. You can also take vitamin B complex daily. Suck ice popsicles or do cool water rinses. Avoid hard and spicy food to prevent further irritation and injury. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

input: Hi, I am on my CD 58 and 26 days period overdue. I tested on 6th, 7th, 14th day of missed period on HPT. but all negative. Went to a gyn and took a test again in her clinic. Again negative. But she still asked me to test the next day with early morning urine to be sure. And only then start Primolut-N 5mg tabs for 3 days thrice a day. The next test was also negative taken on preganews. Now its been 3 days have stopped the tab and no sign of periods. We are TTC for past 4 months. So what could be the reason for delayed periods and also is it possible that the HPTs are negative but I am still pregnant. Thanks in advance.
output: Hi and thanks so much for this query am so sorry to hear about these repeated efforts to conceive without success. 5 months in conception is a very short time, and you would need to keep trying for up to 12 months before we can start suspecting that something isn't going on right with you. From the information you have provided, the chances of you being pregnant are almost zero right now. Not all missed periods are synonymous to pregnancy and this is clearly the case with you. It usually takes averagely 5 days after stopping primal for bleeding to occur. I will suggest you patiently wait for the with Chat Doctor. I hope this helps. Furthermore, I wish you well.

input: I was given amoxicillin for an tooth infection , I took it for three days then stop taken it as the pain went away. Now I believe I have what appears to be a bladder infection(frequent and painful urination). will I be able to take the medicine again? I am a 68 year old male.
output: Hello! Thank you for your question. I understand your query, however next time you take antibiotic, I recommend you to complete the full course of antibiotics such amoxicillin if given for 7 days should be followed even though the condition has improved to avoid antibiotic resistance. For your frequent and painful urination I suggest you take an urinalysis exam as you may be having a Urinary Tract Infection. If Urinary tract infection is confirmed, you may be prescribed with another round of antibiotics such ciprofloxacin 500 mg 2x a day for 7 days. Meanwhile, please do take lots of water. Hope this helps, Feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you and God Bless!

input: About a year ago I came down with an upper respitory infection which caused fluid in my right ear.  I was put on several rounds of anitbiotics which got ride to most of it but still had the feeling that something was in my eustation tube in my ear because it wants to stay closed all the time.  About 2 weeks ago I again was sick and I got two mucus plugs out of my throat.  First on the left side and then about 2 hours later with one on the right side.  The one on the left side was white in color and about the size of a quarter.  The one on the right side was bigger about the size of a 50 cent piece with blood in it.  It still feels as if there is something in my throat.  I have been to so many doctors with 2 CAT scans done and nothing shows up.  Can you give some ideas on what is happening as I am so miserable.  Thanks

As per your query you have upper respiratory tract infection which is causing pain in ear as well is due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.

I would suggest you to consult ENT specialist for proper diagnosis Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like Amoxiclav at least for 10 days along with decongestant and anti-inflammatory. For relieve of infection take levocetrizine. Doctor may order throat swab test, viral culture test and allergy test to confirm the diagnosis. For now do warm saline gargles, take steam twice a day and apply warm Chat Doctor.  You can apply warm compressors on cheek side near ear as well to relieve pressure.

output: Cellophane You for contacting Chat Doctor. Your description is telling that you have chronic allergy problem. You did not mention your age.

Once you find it, you née to prevent it.> In the meanwhile take Montelukast once daily for 1 month. Research has shown that it decreases sensitivity to allergy.> Cetirizine one at night for 1 week in case of allergic response.> try to avoid dust would also suggest you to undergo allergy testing at allergy clinic which will tell that you are allergic to what specific thing. The results will help an allergist to prescribe you immunotherapy to that specific allergen, and it will improve the problem. Hope this answers your question.

input: Hi, 3 weeks ago I fell in my wrist & was told I d probably fractured my scaphoid bone. It was put in a Velcro cast for 10 days & told to come back to fracture clinic for it re xraying & they would decide the course if treatment from there. When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time.
output: Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts

input: What causes hyper aggregation, Doc? Is that hereditary factor? I am  a male, 46 yeras old, office worker, so far having normal blood pressure, as well as all healthy tcholesterol functions. But my latest laboratory check showed that my ADP and Colagen are hyper aggregattion, while the Ephinephrine is normal. Any suggested diet other than medication can be suggested.  Does sport exercise help to improve my blood condition from that hyper aggregation? I was advised by a friend to take thromboaspilet 100mg a day for life. I am worried with the side effect of that long term medication. Look forward to receiving your advice. Thanks, Minarto
output: Hi You do not mentioned any clinical condition, are you a normal person ? Do you have some hereditary related disability ? Look, ADP & collagen, are molecules in side the living being has got their complex role right from metabolism to body building work, now aggregation or hyper aggregation is consequences of certain kind of collagen disease or endocrine disorders, or hematological entity, it is not single area of concern, so the way you have asked is not valid at this stage this could be an academic question & need very lengthy discussion which may be beyond your understanding, have nice day

input: Hi, my 3 yr kid is suffering from 103 fever. I gave him Meftal P 8.5 ml (his wt is 17 KG) but the fever returned after 4 hrs. Earlier Today, the fever returned after 9 hrs and then 5 hrs respectively. What should I do? Should I give him another dose of Meftal P in 1 hr time?
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

Lymph nodal enlargement is seen because of the underlying medical conditions any infections / inflammation it can be localized or systemic or possible lymph nodal pathology itself (lymphadenopathy)4.

Till then, I would prescribe you an anti-spasmodic medicine in case of pain, and also a proton pump inhibitor with a probiotic for your bloating sensation. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

input: I have just started into full menopause a few months ago . I am on wellbution for the depression I have been experiencing but it seems that I am having so much trouble focusing that it its affecting my job . is vyvanse a drug that could help menopausal symptoms ?
output: Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. From what you have stated it is quite clear that you are having a depressive episode. Depression can occur with regular stress, and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or Escitalopram, and they are all very effective and mostly safe. Vyvanse is also a good option.  You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the Chat Doctor.  This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness. Hope I am able to answer your concerns.

A week later my period stopped and i started getting sharp pains in my vagina and I started bleeding again. Did I have a miscarriage then a regular period or a elongated period with sharp pains?

If you continue to have periods with prolonged bleeding then you need to consider visiting your doctor for an assessment. This would include physical examination, hormonal level blood tests and imaging of the reproductive organs by ultrasound.I hope this helps

input: I have 2 lumps on the outside of my right knee. It doesnt hurt to the touch and it gets bigger every now and again. I have had to have knee surgery before, I hyper extended my knee backwards when I was younger. I have had these lumps for awhile now. Im 42 yr old male.

Chew sugarless gums for stimulating saliva. Sialadenitis, i.e. infection of salivary glands starts regressing after 48 hrs with antibiotics. But stones or cyst or other complications need further treatment. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!

input: Hi my son had a fever lasting roughly 5 days followed by a rash lasting another 4-5 days the drs were concerned he had measles and took routine blood work this was the first time he had a cbc. His palette levels were moderately low (131) after his measles test came back negativeI was asked to bring him back a week from orioriginal date for another cbc this time his levels were quite elevated (644) is there a concern I should have to these results? Is it normal to fluctuate that high out of normal range in a matter of weeks or is this something I should bring to a blood specialists? There is a strong family history of leukemia should I be concerned about that as well ?
output: Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Increased platelets level is good and goes against the diagnosis of leukemia.2. So much variation is not possible. Get a second test at other lab or get a platelet count on peripheral smear.3. Along with it, also get a differential leukocyte count to look for immature cells. I would not expect to find anything with normal platelet levels. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

He is now on flagyll, lomotil, and sulpha antibiotic for ear infection. A gallbladder test is scheduled in 2 days. He continues to have fatigue and low grade fever on day 7. Blood culture repeated yesterday. Is this related to the gallbladder? Are we moving too slowly?

When the source is found and the right cause identified then more accurate antibiotic can be used.  Wish you good health.

I was wearing jeans, so there was no direct contact between the skin and concrete, but my skin still ruptured and the skin in the area around the open wound got stuck to my jeans (was sort of scraped off because of the jeans). I had washed the wound and applied antiseptic as soon as I had gotten home, but today the skin area which had scraped off seems to be a yellowish-brownish scab surrounded by reddened skin and the pain in my shin bone surrounding the wound (upto 2 inches above and below the wound) seems to continuously increase. Could there be a serious problem with the wound?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. There is nothing serious about it if there is no fever.

input: i am struggling from shortness of breath after walking 3-4 meters. Once seated and trying to take deep breaths i start losing the shallow breathing, slowly after1 minute. This happens regardless of what i am doing. This has been getting worse since the weekend.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. By your history, in my opinion you are having dyspnea on minimal exertion. Common causes for this are1. Cardiac causes like heart failure, ischemic heart disease etc.2. Pulmonary causes like COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) , fibrosis, etc. So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. Get done chest x-ray and PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to rule out pulmonary causes. So consult doctor and discuss all these.

input: Hi I m 22 year old I had a implanon for 4 years nd had put a new one in April 2013 nd had it removed on June 5th 2014 what I wanna know is can I fell pregnant straight away nd is their a chance I may have a miscarriage nd I have been also having weird symptoms like my belly seems to feel a bit tight at times seem to be weeing abit nd had a day of just spotting I had unprocected sex with my boyfriend on the weekend before my implanon was removed and all so afterwards
output: Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,

input: Hi ,my left arm seems to be getting weaker and sore even in my sleep-most pain in my forearm.I have had a bit of it in my right arm but is not so bad now. I am a machine operator and have not had much exercise this year. I would like to but the pain is too much and I dont know if Ill cause more damage. Any thoughts?
output: Hello, I have studied your case. Pain in the forearm can be due to weakness or can be due to overuse. You have not told me in detail about your other illness. I would suggest you get a compression bandage for forearm and avoid putting pressure on one side. You can also take Broken tablet for pain relief. Hot water fomentation and Volition gel are also helpful. I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other follow-up questions. Thanks

input: hi I m wondering if radiation for stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer would be beneficial. the patient is already taking strong chemo and a lot of herbal supplements. Feels good except after treatments. What pills and treatment would you suggest Thank u
output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Treatment of pancreatic cancer depends on type and stage as well as spread of cancer.  In early stage surgery is useful. In late stage chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain mainstay in the treatment. Radiotherapy is useful in some types of pancreatic cancer.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

I m wondering if I injured my femoral nerve because my groin and inside of my legs hurt all the down to my ankles, along with my knee and leg pain?
output: Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that it is important performing some investigations to differentiate between two main possible causes that may lead to your symptoms: - a joint inflammation- a articular pain radiating from your back (nerve compression).

output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Weight of your baby is very less for age, you have not mentioned her birth weight. Your baby seems to suffering from gastroenteritis give her ORS, zinc. You also need to show her to your pediatrician early as she is weak and prone to severe infection without warning signs like fever. You need to give her a balanced diet with variety, and supplements after consulting your doctor, Cowlicks alone is not going to help , I usually do not recommend it. There is also a need to find cause of her poor weight, was she born with low birth weight, what diet is she taking, is her appetite poor or weight not increasing despite good appetite ? All questioned needs to answered and her diet to be planned accordingly in consultation with your doctor. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing your child good health.

input: I eat meat regularly, but rarely eat steak. The other day I had steak for dinner and later that night it felt like there was a knot in my stomach, then finally had a large bowel movement and felt like a million bucks. The next day I had the leftovers and later that night the cramping came back and has lasted 2 days so far. I keep feeling like I have to have another large bowel movement but am only able to get rid of a few pebble-sized feces. My wife who had the same dinner is fine. What can I do to alleviate this?

input: I got my wisdom teeth removed a month ago. I ended up getting dry socket and an infection so the doctor gave me more medication. I started to heal and even flushed out the sockets. Not I have a lump along my jawline that is tender to the touch. Is it possible that food got stuck in the socket?
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The lump over the jaw line can be because of the infection of the bone that is garret osteomyelitis.

If it is not reducing in a week, consult an oral physician and take an causal radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: Took Keflex for an infection on my eye lid, now I have a horrible red rash on my chest and it is slowly going away. But this morning I woke up with a red rash under both breasts.  When will it clear up?  It has been  5 weeks now. I stopped the Keflex two and half weeks ago. I have Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%, will this clear it up?

You can use detail liquid for bath, pour few Chat Doctor. Wear cotton clothes. And have blood test to rule out DM. I think, you will be alright . I hope you got my answer. Thanks.

input: Hi,2 days before i went to Sehat Clinic (Chennai, India) for hair loss problem. The doctor witnessed me and prescribed two tablets named "Nano Hair Revitalizer & VB7 Forte". I have not yet started taking those tablets, i have a question whether is there any side effects taking those tablets?Please answer my question..Thanks,Suresh S
output: DearWelcome to Chat Doctor ! Your details have been evaluated, and I find that certain vital details are missing. If I were your dermatologist, I would have asked you detailed history, examined you and the affected hairs, got some investigations done to substantiate your diagnosis. Most common causes of hair loss are halogen effluvium in which there is diffuse hair loss from all over scalp and the other one is An Chat Doctor. These two are common causes, but other diseases have to be ruled out by history and examination. In my opinion, it is recommended that first a diagnosis is made, and then proper treatment is instituted. I request you to provide the other required details so that your hair can be as healthy as those of normal person of your age. In the meantime, please avoid massaging too vigorously, have a healthy diet, adequate rest, and use a mild shampoo once or twice a week. This will surely aid in early recovery. Best wishes.

input: Hi I have cushing disease, lyme disease, fibromyalgia, occipital neuralgia and have been treated with antibiotics for over a year now and wbc and neutrophils are still elevated and dont understand why if being on antibiotics for over a year could this mean something
output: Cushing's disease itself can cause elevated WBC, so this may not necessarily be related to an infection. Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g., abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps.

input: Hi, I will be coming back to India/Bangalore in the last week of jan 2009. I have a 2.5 month old son & he is having the Acid Reflux problem, here we give the Prevacid Solutab medicine to him everyday. Will this tablet/medicine be available in Bangalore??
output: The medication which you have mentioned is Lansoprazole. The medication is not available in the brand name of Prevail, but it is available in other brand names like Rancid, Landry, Ransom, Landon etc. The main treatment for the acid reflux for the baby is to properly burp the child after every feed which will help the air to come out of mouth which it has swallowed while taking feed.

output: HelloThanks for query. Your boyfriend has developed peeling of skin over shaft of the penis after applying hair removal cream. This is mostly due to allergic reaction to hair removing cream.

Doctors advised Medical management over bypass and Angioplasty as She is Diabetic, Hypertension as well as her arteries are vary narrow. What should we do, as even on hugh medicine, she contineously has breathless ness entire day.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. She is a ideal candidate for bypass surgery. Triple vessels' disease with hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol are an absolute indication for Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She is symptomatic (breathlessness) despite medicines.

input: I had a grand mal seizure about 3 weeks ago, I am 72 years old and had never had a seizure before. I was under severe stress, no sleep for many days and was caring for my husband who died a week later. Anyway I was kept in the hospital for three days because I had developed before the seizure the ability to carry on a conversation and my words were staggered. Tonight I think I took my afternoon Dilantin and I took my night time one because my pill box for the afternoon dose was empty. What do you think is the right way if this happens again?
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First seizure needs evaluation to find out the underlying cause of seizures. I presume you underwent MRI of brain, EEG and other blood tests. Regarding Dilation, you need to take 5 mg per kg body weight. So, if your weight is about 60 kg, then, a daily dose of 300 mg is needed. A capsule of Dilation is 100 mg, so, you would need three capsules daily. Since the duration of action is 24 hours, for convenience’s sake, you can take the entire three capsules together at night. Other options include taking one in morning, after noon and night each OR one in morning and two at night. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Then they cut more skin away and dressed it. l was told that it must be dressed every day that has happend with my wife cleaning the wound and making sure that it stays clean.

output: Hello Mr. Paul Wintershausen Since you are a diabetic and taking INSULIN and wound is not healing in spite of the treatment. This is a" diabetic foot" :Presentation of diabetic foot is of three type :1 Neuropathic foot in which neuropathy dominates .2 The neuroischemic foot, in which occlusive vascular disease is the main factor .3 Non-neuroishemic but purely infected foot. Since you are a diabetic patient, so any of above possibility may be the reason of NON-HEALING DIABETIC FOOT. In my opinion you must consult a PLANETOLOGIST and get his opinion. If color of infected toe is reddish bluish and foul smell is there then you may have developed GANGRENE. So at earliest consult a PLANETOLOGIST and get his opinion. Hope this will help you.

input: Hi, I occasionally have a combination of 3 things at once, lasting for less then a minute. I get very dizzy, with metallic taste in my mouth and tingling feeling on the side of my tongue. Nowadays it occurs about once a month and leaves me with no after effects. I am a 48 yrs old male and have had this happening for about 10 years now, seemingly getting more frequent in the last couple of years. I am an ex-smoker with high blood pressure, asthma and Crohn`s disease.

input: hi mam, im 23 years old got married 3 months. I wanna to get pregnant faster im getting my periods regularly now but minimum flow and getting spotting 15 days back is this an ovulation time? I got pcod 1 year back i took crimson tablets is there any problem to conceive? Pls reply me thank u.
output: Hello dear, i understand your concern. In my opinion there might not be any problem in conceiving if your cycles are regular. The cause for minimal flow like thyroid abnormalities should be ruled out.Also, as you have a history of POD previously an ultrasound might be needed to check for the POD status. First and most important is avoided stress and anxiety related to pregnancy because they cause hormonal imbalance and delay the conception further. If ultrasound and thyroid profile are normal then nothing to worry. Practice regular intercourse to increase the conception chances. Best regards... Chat Doctor.

input: I have dry scaly skin on my buttocks . I attempted to use cortisone initially, but now I think this skin disorder is fungal in nature.

input: I am 24 years of age. I had a tumor surgically taken out. After its biopsy it was found to be pure dysgerminoma. The tumor was confined to one overy. It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is immature teratoma. However, higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry.

input: Hello, I have extremely sore and itchy nipples. I have been using anti fungal cream for a month and its not helping and I also had an ultra sound on my breasts 2 weeks ago and it came back clear. My ex used to cheat on me alot so could it be a symptom of an STI ? Any ideas what it could be? Thanks
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Sore and itchy nipples are not the signs and symptoms of Sexually Transmitted Infection. I would be due to some other infections preferably of fungal origin. The fungal infection will be more common in this area because the fungus can survive and grow in the wet and moist area. As you are having the symptoms of itching and soreness it sounds like a fungal infection. I would suggest you to follow1. Keep that area Chat Doctor. Topical Antifungal cream3. Oral Antihistamines4. Oral Antifungal 

input: I have a red spot on my left knee that at first looked like a mosquito bite but came to a head yesterday and then started oozing yellow pus. Now I have another sore starting on my right calf. Both are itchy. I ve been fighting a bad cold for 10 days and am concerned that these may not be bites. Thoughts?
output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is possible that they are bites that have become infected. Bites can become infected when bacteria are introduced from under the nails during itching. It is not likely that they are linked to the cold that you are currently fighting. The use of topical antibiotics may help but if they do not resolve with topical treatment then oral antibiotics would be needed. You should also consider repellent to prevent further bites. I hope this helps

input: In the past couple months I have been having an extreme sharp pain in my left abdomen. The pain causes me to be unable to breath and I fall to the floor unable to move because of how severe the pain is. I went to the doctor for it and gave them all my symptoms, period for 6 weeks, fatigued, headaches, heartburn. All of my tests came back normal, but I have still having this pain and when it hits it is very scary.Do you have any idea of what it could be or what my next step should be?
output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would go for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any pelvic adnexal disease or a urinary stone disease on the left side. Apart from it, any kind of pelvic infection or an UTI could also give rise to such pain. To rule this out, you have to get yourself examined clinically by a gynecologist, followed by a urine routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity test and also an ultrasound of the abdomen. Therefore, I would advise you to take appointment with a gynecologist if not done already. Till then, you could go for an antispasmodic Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor

input: Hey This is a sex question regarding to pregnancy. Yesterday i was with my girlfriend fooling around and I ejaculated on her chest area. We waited for a minute or less and I started to wipe it dry off her chest.

So my question is what do all these symptoms mean? ive been to my primary care doctor and he performed blood work for fibromyalgia as well as rheumatoid arthritis but everything comes out clear.
output: Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that it is important performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis between different possible causes that may lead to this clinical situation: a bulging disc in the cervical column, vitamin D deficiency, fibromyalgia, etc. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests: - a cervical spine X-ray study-complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance-vitamin D plasma levels.  A cervical spine MRI study may be needed, coupled with nerve conduction studies.  You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.  Hope I have answered your query.

I currently take Naproxen 500 mg tab 2 daily for hip pain and Gabapentin 300 mg 2 capsules at bedtime for restless legs and 1 tab of Ropinirole at bedtime for restless legs. I thought that maybe the Diclofenac Sodium could be taken in place of the Naproxen. Thank you Jeanne

input: I have a hard lump in my lower left abdomen.  The  area is tender to touch and pain is in my back behindwhere the lump is found.  I have a past history of cancer of thyroid and radiation therapy.  Frequent bowel movements that are ribbon shaped and occasional bleeding.
output: Hi, You should get examined by a Surgeon for the lump and the bleeding. It could be Diverticulitis and/ or Hemorrhoids.

input: Due to pain radiating from my kidneys, I was sent for an ultra sound back in January. After the technician sent results, they referred to what they found as a nodule . I was sent to the imaging center the next day to get a CT scan complete with dye through and IV. In conclusion they found that I have a benign cyst & that I was to drink plenty of water.... My question is: Should I be concerned that it is something more? I have severe pain radiating from my left side (I know for a fact it is not muscular) that is worse at night/ upon awakening. Sometimes it is dull/throbbing and others sharp and painful. I have also been having horrible headaches in the morning, which started about 2 weeks ago. My Grandmother died of Pancreatic cancer in her early 50s.
output: Hi, benign cyst of kidney is not so uncommon. They some time cause severe pain, but they require no treatment. One can use oral NSAIDs or heads at the time of pain. In my practice I find them quite helpful to my patient. If the size of the cyst is large, and they cause severe pain effecting your daily activity then they ma require surgery. Thanks

input: I have been diagnosed with a cyst on either my esophages or my Bronchi (they aren t sure yet). I have had an MRI and a CT scan both with contrast. I am now being told that I need another gated MRI. I am being treated now for stomach ulcers. I cough all the time. What are the chances that they will be able to fix this without major surgery?
output: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Esophageal and or bronchial cyst if symptomatic than should be removed surgically. Surgery is the treatment of choice for such cyst. And it is better to remove this cyst as chances of following complications are high if these cysts are left untreated.1. Infection2. Rupture3. Fistula formation.4. Pressure symptoms on surrounding structures. So better to remove this cyst surgically.

input: I just had my teeth pulled and am wearing temporary dentures.  My teeth were pulled on 10/25.  I was given  chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.  I have been out of that medication for a week.  My tongue turned a chocolate milk color during using the rinse.  Now that I havent used it for a week, my tongue is still turning that color.  Infection or side effect?
output: Hello, Yes. It is one of the side of chlorhexidine gluconate mouth wash. It is not due to infection. Some other usual side effects.1. Tooth/tongue staining 2. Increased tartar3. Mouth/throat irritation4. Change in taste of food/ Chat Doctor. 1. To decrease staining of teeth and mouth surfaces, brush with toothpaste 3 times daily, brushing more on the stained areas2. Use of a "tartar control" toothpaste and electric toothbrush may be more effective.3. To decrease the effect on how food tastes, eat first, followed by tooth brushing and then chlorhexidine rinse.4. See your dentist at least every 6 months for tooth cleaning/tartar removal.5. Staining from this medication that may occur on dental work (such as crowns or veneers) usually can only be removed by a dentist/hygienist. Wishing you good health.

Both times the colonoscopy showed funky white (according to the pictues) spots all over my colon. They did a biopsy and it was negative, but the second doctor asked if I took a lot of naproxin or Alleve, which I do. He said that s notorious for tearing up your colon. Is that true? Could it be anythig else like IBS or diverticulitis. Or something? I ve been avoiding Alleve for over a year, but my wrist and shoulder are both bothering me again.

input: Hi I am on 300mg of Effexor for ocd, and I am always exhausted and very vacant. My memory is hopeless, I can give a shop assistant my card and then stress straight away wondering what I have done with it. I know I have to be on medication because I really struggle otherwise but was wondering if I can decrease my dosage or try another medication. Thank you. Wendy
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your description. I suggest you not to worry too much. If you are a typical OCD client, then you should have been advised about OCD fully. It is mandatory. The stress goes with OCD, and it is easily overcome. As long as your memory is concerned, it is not failing. It actually is overwhelmed. You are preoccupied with obsessional thoughts which fails your memory. OCD clients should learn how to tackle this, how to think away from obsessive thoughts. You might need OCD therapy and other behavioral therapies. I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological help through Chat Doctor. Contact me through customer care, www.ChatDoctor .com.

OR O.D. 1st - Trigger point injections into 1/2muscle with lidocaine, no epi - multiple appts.(unknown amounts of time and money), some manual adjustments , some exercises to open up hips (connection of pain in shoulder to posture etc), some arm exercises but unable to do because of pain My questions are 1. What is the most effective procedure? 2. What is the best sequencing of treatment? 3. Are alternative treatment modalities necessary always after steroid injections and exercise if relief is present? 4. To prevent this issue from reoccurring are there certain exercises/life management and/or dietary adjustments that have proven to be helpful? Thanks

input: I have a degenrated disc at my L4/L5 level. It is at about 25% degeneration. My L5/S1 also has some slight degenration. I found out after pulling a muscle in my back 4 years ago. My right leg is about a centimeter shorter than my left, which is the main cause of the degeneration. I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain. I have also been experiencing intermittent pain in my left testicle. It comes and goes and sometimes moves to the right testicle. I have also noticed a frequent urge to urinate. I have noticed that not as much urine comes out and I still feel like I have to go shortly thereafter. If I massage the area near the rectum and behind the scrotum, it provides relief. Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners. There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine, blood in urine/ejaculate, etc. I have had issues with urination for at least 10 years. They include constant urge, inability to urinate when I feel the urge. I am currently uninsured, so I am trying to find some possible answers before I make it into a doctors office.
output: Hi, In my opinion the radiating pain in your testicles isn't coming from the herniation or the medications you take it actually came from you renal system which is mentioned of having history of issues for the past ten years, so I think you have some sort of renal stone or a gravel in your ureters that prevents you from urinating freely to the end. You will need some investigation like SUA, RH factor, ASCOT Title, urinalysis and U/S of your abdomen and pelvis to know exactly where is the pathology exactly for specific treatments.  I would recommend higher fluid intake, low proteins and carboy Chat Doctor.  Please click THANK YOU and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful.

My 7 year old daughter suddenly had a pain in her neck friday night. Within 5 minutes of her saying that her neck was huring, she developed a fever. Within 15 minutes of the fever she was sleep. I woke her up to ask her about her neck about a hour later, it had stopped hurting but she was extremely thirsty. It has been 24 hours and she is stil having frequent fevers every two or three hours, no other irritations other than stomach was hurting about a hour ago. She had a bowel movement and is now asleep. Should I take her to the E.R. Her fevers have been between 99.9-111.5. My next question is in regards to myself.

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about heart diseases as your 2d echo and TMT (trade mill test) are normal. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal cause for your chest discomfort. Your chest discomfort is associated with exertion (playing tennis), so musculoskeletal cause is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal discomfort. 1. Avoid awkward movements. 2. Sit with proper back and chest support. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: My husband has had stomach issues for 2 years now. When it first happened he complained of severe stomach pain in his upper middle to left abdomen. He also had a fever. We took him to the E.R. and he was diagnosed with Diverticulitis after a CT scan with contrast. Due to not having insurance at the time, we never followed up until this past month. He had a colonoscopy done and they found nothing to even suggest he has diverticulitis. They also eliminated Crohn s and Celiac disease. The only thing we have noticed that aggravates the pain is steak so he avoids it but still has the pain. He describes it as a bruised feeling. It s a dull pain unless he eats something that aggravates it or if the area is touched then it is a sharp pain, and he says it s not a cramping pain at all, just a very bad bruised feeling. It also causes him weird bowel movements that range from diarrhea one day to close to constipation the next. His doctor is treating him for Irritable Bowel but the medicine hasn t helped at all.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Read the history and understood the problems of your husband. The diarrhea, constipation sometimes, pain in abdomen, CT scan which showed diverticula in the past, but the recent colonoscopy is absolutely normal. Yes, he is suffering from the Irritable Bowel Syn Chat Doctor. If the medicines are not helping, the probable causes and the treatment area as follows:-Notice more than the steaks, which food stuffs and beverages cause / increase his problems. -Increase the dose of the medicines o give more effect or may be change over to another medicines. -Stress and anxiety are the biggest contributory factors, and he has to keep them under control at any cost, with yoga, meditation and / or medicines.

output: Dear patient You have got para paresis due to back injury. This is serious issue, and you need to consult spine surgeon as soon as possible. Spinal cord and nerves travels through spinal canal and back trauma may lead to vertebral fracture or disc prolapse with spinal cord compression.  Spinal cord compression leads to weakness in both legs and loss of bowel and bladder control. This if not treated in time may not recover. So the need of urgent consultation. I would advise MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine to confirm diagnosis.  Visit expert spine surgeon with report. All the best.

input: My 10 month old has had a bad cold and hacking cough for the last 5 weeks. Almost continual streaming nose and lots of phlegm. This morning he projectile vomited up all his milk. I then tried him on solids, but half an hour later he projectile vomited all his solids up. Any advice on next steps? He doesn t have a temperature and seems happy otherwise.
output: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that about your child. His cough and colds can trigger the vomiting. You said he has lots of phlegm, the body will try to eliminate it. You can try small frequent feeding, in that way the stomach is not full when he coughs. Also, when you feed him, keep him upright. We want to prevent the risk of aspiration. Monitor him for any signs of difficulty in breathing and or deny Chat Doctor.  If any of these appears, bring him to his doctor for proper assessment. I hope I was able to help you. Have a good day! Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics

input: My dad has lung cancer and just in the last two days he has become very confused and cannot put sentences together, cannot feed himself, walk, or go to the restroom on his own...does this appear to perhaps reached his brain or could this be from the strong pain patches that he has been on for just a few days now? Thanks
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. There are few causes for altered mental status and confusion in lung cancer patients. 1. Spread of tumor in brain.2. Electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia (low sodium).3. Acute psychosis from the fact of having incurable disease. So get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastases. Get done S. Na+ to rule put hyponatremia. If both are normal than consult psychiatrist to rule out acute psychosis.

input: Over the past 3 days, my pelvis has been painful to touch, mostly on my right side as if there is a bruise just under the skin, although I havent done anything that may have caused this. I have no other symptoms or pain, just a lot of tenderness in that area, around a golf ball sized area.

input: My 8 month old has HFM, and is in a lot of pain. Blisters everywhere, barely able to sleep and is inconsolable when awake. Other than giving him Tylenol and offering cold things to chew on I m not sure what to do to keep him comfortable enough to sleep?
output: Hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that is frequently seen now-a-days. Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days. Management is supportive. Giving Tylenol should reduce the pain and help. Use lidocaine oral gel over the oral lesions, and it will help in relieving the pain. You may give pedicloryl syrup and help the child sleep. I am sorry that you would need to be a bit patient.

input: About 8 days ago I was bending over while placing a box on a shelf in the garage, and heard a pop on my side.

output: Hellos your father stated that this pain is due to gastritis (caused by alcohol intake) , sanitizing is not working. When such case visit with excruciating pain, patient need to take antacid (if it contains tetracaine, better)4 T S F (until and unless contraindicated) according to necessity.

input: back in 1998 I broke my c6 and damaged my dic between c 6 c5 for 3 years I was bed ridin chronic pain 2002 they put me on dilaudid 2mg 4 tm dy which made some diff then added 25 mcg fen now I am at 175 mcg fen one 100 and one 75 also dilaudid 4 mg 4 times day now my doc for trial they want me to try drop the dilaudid and try 30mg of morphin 3 times aday the fen stay the same which would work best or a complete revamp I need to get some life back I am 71 and my name stuart
output: Hi Stuart, Dilaudid contains an opioid HY Chat Doctor.  So if your doctor wishes to shift you from diluted to morphine, in my opinion, it will be better to ask him clearly what his reasons are for advising the change. If you were comfortable on the previous regimen, then there is no point in making any change. Best wishes.

input: I have general gum recession on my bottom teeth and slight recession on my upper canines. Im thinking about getting gum grafts to cover the exposed root surfaces. But as Im currently wearing braces, Im not sure what I should do. Should I wait until the orthodontic treatment is over and then get gum grafts? Or is during the orthodontic treatment fine?
output: Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. As you are wearing orthodontic braces for teeth alignment, your teeth will take new position due to it root movements.Therefore, it is best to go for gum grafts only after that. Also remember mild recession can itself get corrected after orthodontic braces removal. It is only in severe recession cases you need to get your gums covered with tissues through grafts. That will reduce your teeth sensitivity as well as enhance esthetically. Meanwhile, it is advised to get your teeth cleaned once, upon consulting your orthodontist, because deposition of calculus and stains also leads to gum recession. Maintain very good oral hygiene, and you can use antiseptic mouth rinses too. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.

input: I recently had a stent put in my left carotid artery and am on Plavix. I have developed sizable bruise on my forearm which has a hard knot in the center of it. Do I need to see my doctor about this or will it just go away? Could it be a blood clot even tho I am on a blood thinner?
output: Hi, Greetings from Chat Doctor. Since you had a stent put on your left carotid artery you have to be on a blood thinner medicine like clopidogrel or aspirin which prevent platelet aggregation and clotting. If you have developed a bruise it is due to clopidogrel overdose. If it's enlarging in size or if multiple bruises are appearing you need to consult doctor and adjust the dose of clopidogrel

input: I have a daughter who s hair is starting to fall out since she was a baby. I thought it s normal until 2 months ago, her hair falls double. I went to different dermatologists but they can t give me an answer to what is causing for this hair fall. I thought it s due to malnutrition for she s thin and never had a regular milk to drink for she s allergic to milk. But I have been giving her powder milk and she seems to be gaining weight but the hair fall doesn t stop. Please help me find out what is causing my daughter s hair fall before her hair starts receeding in front. Thank you so much.
output: Hi, Hair fall can be due to zinc and protein deficiency. Give her zinc supplements like Sure and high protein diet like meat, eggs.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hi there, I have been having problems with my stomach for the past few  weeks! I feel bloated and vomit after food but I dont throw anything up. I have also felt some lumps on my upper stomach right under my chest bones mainly my right side. The lumps are getting more and when I touch they hurt! Can you please give me some advice.
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Bloating and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms, but these lumps you're feeling are definitely something that must be evaluated! You should do at least ultrasound to rule some serious diagnosis out. Usually such symptoms are caused by gastritis, gErd or hiatus hernia, so gastrostomy should be performed too. There is no specific cure. If you have only gastritis this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee,smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. But as I said, I really suggest to DI some imaging tests do investigate these lumps. Wish you good health.

input: I noticed bruising on both left and right legs after driving 12 hours straight (took four 1 hr breaks in between to get gas and food). Is this unexplained bruising related to sitting down too long in the car or it is something serious that I need to see my doctor.

Skin bruises on bilateral lower limb after prolonged Chat Doctor.  So get done PT (prothrombin time), APT (activated prothrombin time) and bilateral lower limb venous Doppler. If all are normal then no need to worry. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

My daughter in law is worried about her taking the medicine and asked for a Consultant to look at her. The first visit he said try a dairy free diet, this did not make any difference. Now she has a very swollen tummy and has lost weight. She has also been off her food the last couple of weeks eating very little. She has also cut another couple of teeth so we thought it might be that. The hospital have taken xray of her stomach, and she will be having some blood tests in the next couple of weeks.

input: Hi my name is sahira, 29 age, my husband is 31 yrs old. We are trying for a baby now I am taking Menogon 3 inj on alternate days and 1 pregnyl inj, how many chances of conceiving are with this inj? My hormones and my husband tests are clear. O have 2 fibroids in my uterus, does conceiving effect it?
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe both of you are perfect in the tests of gynecologist, you need not have this treatment. But if 3 years passed after the marriage, most of the doctors use this treatment.  Mention is a purified combination of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. To induce ovulation and enable pregnancy in women.  In women, Chat Doctor is used together with other hormones called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treatment of infertility.  So there is every possibility of getting pregnant. It needs per vaginal ultrasound scanning at the time of expected ovulation, to see there is maturation of the follicles, and ovulation.  If you don't get pregnant in the first time, you may become pregnant you will become pregnant in the second cycle. So never get confused, or get anxiety, as they may spoil the process.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

input: My grandson has a bad case of acne and seen Christa Heard CRNP today. She recommended antibiotics and a cream to be applied morning and night, to make a long story short the medicine was 600. dollars and I am a single woman raising my grandchild needless to say he was very upset when we left the drugstore what or where do we go from here? Sandra
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that 600 dollars is a huge amount and it's even puzzling to me why a course of antibiotics and a cream would cost that much.  I presume that you don't have insurance, so the only option would be to be prescribed more cost-effective medication.  Furthermore, I would suggest that you can let the CRNP know that you cannot afford the medication and request her to prescribe something else more cost-effective and affordable. Since acne is not a serious condition, I don't think your grandson needs a very strong antibiotic or other expensive medication.  Wish you all the best.

input: My resting heart rate at the doctors office today was 132.  I have narcolepsy and am on Adderall XR 30mg bid and Adderall IR 10mg tablets 2-4 times daily for afternoon sleepiness.  My blood pressure was normal 120/77.  Should I be concerned about my heart rate?  The last time I was in the office it was 110 just sitting in his office.
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your resting heart rate values are a little high, but they can be related to Adderall IR adverse effects (it is known to increase the heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system). As your blood pressure values are normal, the situation does not seem to be really concerning. But, I would recommend performing some other tests to be sure that everything is OK: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rate values for a prolonged time-complete blood count for anemia-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. If all these tests result normal, there is nothing to worry about. If your heart rate is persistently high, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health, 

input: My blood pressure has been low for the last month. 88/58. Now I just noticed 2 marble size lumps on the side of my neck. I had a fever earlier in the week and problems with allergies. Lost 55 pounds recently and lowered salt intake. Nor sure if all is related.
output: CLUMPS IN THE NECK CAN BE A INDICATOR OF INFECTION OR IT CAN BE ANYTHING SERIOUS LIKE CARCINOMA(cancer)sides of the neck has many nodes called as lymph node, its function is to trap any infectious agent in the body, swelling in lymph node indicates that there are infectious agents in body, as your lymph nodes are trapping those infectious agents, the size is increasing however in some case swollen nodes are an indicator of carcinoma its very possible that these enlarged nodes are pressing the vagus nerve which passes in the vicinity, vagus plays an imp role in maintaining blood pressure, increased pressure on vagus can lower the BP due to overstimulationbut a fever is indicative of ongoing infection would suggest you total leukocyte countdiffrential leukocyte count complete blood count test to rule out any ongoing infection if its normal then a Fine needle aspiration cytology of enlarged nodes should be done to rule out carcinoma

input: My fiancee had a stint put in after her gallbladder surgery. Today we had the stint removed at 1pm, we ate lunch (she had a small steak with a sweet potato), and she felt fine until 630pm where she started to experience a chill. She does not have a temperature but is still experiencing chills. Should I monitor her temperature to see if she has a fever , give her a Motrin, or take her to the hospital. Friends have recommended giving her a tylenol and watch to see if she gets a fever.
output: Hi, you have got removed the CBD stent. Why was this put?was it cholecystitis/cholelithiasis/common bile duct stone.

input: I m very terrified. I just noticed a very dark purple almost black lump in the back of my mouth about half an inch or so after my moler. Causes no pain unless messed with. WHAT IS IT?! Is it deadly?! Can I cure it at home?! Please say yes! WHY IS IT THERE PLEASE HELP!!!
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dilated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varix. The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus. It is not AA serious condition and will not cause any serious problem. It can gradually reduce in size on its own. If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Muscle, Hematoma or a Hematoma. Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

input: I have been experiencing hip pain/upper thigh pain that was intermittent and now is consistent.  It is more of a burning type pain.  The pain disrupts sleep and is painful while sitting still. I am a 53yr old female, 175lbs.  Last year  blood work shows my white blood cell count to be slightly elevated but I have seen a oncologist who didnt find anything.  I also have been very tired and have been getting frequent headaches.  I was recently diagnosed with a autoimmune disease Vitilago.  I have seen a dermatalgist and endocrinologist.  No one has any answer.  Where do I go now?
output: Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold. A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold), Losing weight, taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin, Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans, which may also present with similar picture. So, I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed clinical examination and further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day

input: I had a skiing accident that caused a hematoma on about 50% of my hip a little over 10 years ago. My hip started to bother me when I laid on it about 6 months ago. Now the pain is to the point I cannot sit for more than 15 minutes with out my hip, knee, leg, and feet aching and sometimes get a warm sensation where the hematoma was. There is still a bump on my hip where the bruise was. I also never had any procedure for the hematoma. Should I see a doctor asap or am I ok waiting for my appointment with my general doctoc?
output: HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor, Due to blunt injury there can be hematoma collection. The bleeding that occurs result in hematoma collection. Over a period of time, as hematoma resolves it cause local skin symptoms around the hematoma. I would suggest you to apply ice and thrombhophobe ointment will help and take adequate rest. If required you may need to do blood investigation for prognosis and recovery. Take precaution to avoid infection around hematoma.

output: Hithank-you for providing the brief history of you let me make a correction that C5-C6 comes in neck region and not L5-L6?.as you mentioned your history what I can understand is that you have pain & tingling in the arm up to the fingers.these symptoms arise due to Cervical spine disc pathology. For which I can recommend you to take physical therapy. This will help you reduce the pain and tingling sensation. Also on a later stages exercises will be introduced.in my clinical practice, I have seen many cases with similar issues and all response well to physical therapy.regards Jay In Chat Doctor. 

input: My husband has a large, hard mass in the sternum. It has been there for about a year however in the past few months he has developed severe stomach pains, nausea immediately after eating and severe heart burn. His stomach constantly feels full and he spends a lot of time in the restroom. Is should also mention that about 8 years ago he was diagnosed with pre cancer of the stomach. This weekend the stomach pains were so severe that he could not get out of the bed. Could this be something serious? He is 44, 5 10 and weighs 210.
output: HI. This is definitely a serious matter as he was diagnosed to have a pre-cancerous lesion in the stomach. He needs upper GI Endoscopy. The mass on the sternum is not related. I would advise for this HERD like symptoms the following: Santa 12 hourly. Pepcid every 3 to 4 hours when on empty stomach. Add Risperidone or such motility regulators. Soft bland diet. No aerated colas / soda/ Chat Doctor. Early dinner. No late nights. Treatment for anxiety (as prescribed / needs a prescription by your Doctor)Lying in a reclining positional around after dinner. Think of the factors which increased the present problem, HERD, anxiety and try to avoid. If no relief, get Upper GI endoscopy done and get prescription for added Medicines. EKG for the heart n a safer side to rule out cardiac problems. This helps all my patients and should help you, hopefully.

input: I was just diagnosed with crohns desise a few months ago. Im also taking medicine for indigestion and heartburn.  a few weeks ago I started this pain in my upper left abdomen, my gastro didnt seem concerned and my family doctor said it was a pulled muscle from coughing. pain has subsided for now. Last night I was woken up to severe stomach pain/ burning sensation in the middle of my stomach and severe nausea and started sweating. I could feel my heart racing. I did throw up a little and it calmed down a little bit but am still nauseated this morning.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. You are suffering from Crowns, this is a recurrent problem and most probable be the reason or the pain in abdomen you have. It is better to get re-investigated for the fresh attack of pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating you had as there may be another problem associated. I would advise you the following:Get the blood, urine and stool test done. Standing X-ray of the abdomen and Ultrasonography. Get a course of additional medicines if advised so. Get PPI, Domperoidone, antacid. Alter the diet to suit the intestines. If required you can always take a second opinion of another Doctor or Gastroenterologist.

input: I have suffered from what seemed to be RA for five years now. I was treated with methotrexate yet continued to suffer joint pain at times when having allergic reactions. I was tested by an allergy doctor and told I did not test positive to any known allergens on tests. Yet continue to have knee joint pain and itchy tattoos that turn bumpy throughout the year. On and off. I discontinued Methotrexate treatment and I went on a hunch and was treated for Lyme disease. I am around rescue dogs as a hobby not all the time. I got better and was able to walk again. However now I find whenever I have allergic reactions itchy tattoos sinus issues my knees become painful again. Any ideas? Tatto related?
output: Hello, I can understand your concern for side effects of tattoos. After analyzing your query it appears that you are quite stressed regarding the tattoos and its side effects. Though in general if the tattoos are made in sterile procedure then there is no any harm of the same but in case if the tattoos are carved by unsterile needle or is made with infected needle then can transmit multiple infections. Temporarily it can cause secondary infection and later on the tattoos can cause permanent darkening of the skin which is actually difficult to be managed. You can take further guidance from a family physician. Take care.

input: Hi, my 79yo mother noticed a lump in her neck on the left side, mid jaw line, extending from just below the jaw to the middle of her neck.  It is soft, no pain.  She has been running a low grade fever and has been very tired.  The doctor ordered a ultrasound which was inconclusive and sent her to a surgeon.  She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.  Her thyroid studies at her last physical 6 months ago were normal.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, your mother is mostly suffering from thyroid cancer. Her CT report clearly mentioned left sided mass and right sided nodule. So possibility of papillary thyroid cancer is more. Old age is an independent risk factor. It is usually painless and present only as enlarged mass in the neck. So better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for the confirmation of papillary thyroid cancer. Consult oncologist and plan future treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

AUDREY
output: Hi, Thanks for your query. Numbness in the toes indicate that there is some sort of neurological disturbance (impaired conduction of nerve impulse) in the involved nerves. This may result due to compression of the nerve at some level during its course or may also result due to some systemic diseases. A detailed clinical examination and few investigations like EMG & Nerve conduction studies are needed to establish a correct diagnosis of your problem. I suggest you to consult a Neurophysician and follow the advice. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

input: Hi sir!I am sekhar and 33 years of age.I have a pimple in my head of penis and a hard lump in my groin area since last 10 months.Recently i have examined those by 2 doctors(surgeon) and they told me that the lump is a cyst and it is now too tiny to remove.Sometimes i feel slite pain(rather irritation) from the lump but the pimple is painless.what should i do?
output: Hello, It would be of great help if you could share the picture of your cyst so that I can comment over its treatment.  Cysts are usually fat deposits below the skin or a clogged hair follicle. If its causing pain go and see your doctor again to see if It's infected or not and get your treatment accordingly.

input: I had a complete hysterectomy 8 yrs ago. I WAS PUT ON A NUMBER of ssrs and finally found Prozac to work. I was put on Xanax for anziety. having more issues with panick attacks due to high stress last year. dr is talking mood stabilizer oxcarbazepine. will that help
output: ! If your diagnosis is just anxiety disorder and not bipolar disorder, then oxecarbazepien will be best avoided.  There is many milder and better molecules which can help you and will not require many dosage level monitoring (like oxecarbazepien). You may go for venlafaxine or paroxetine, or combination with Aquitaine. These all are good at handling anxiety and panic attacks. Your doctor will know about them. Hope this helps you please feel free to ask more questions for clarification

input: HI,Myself Balaji, my mom is admitted in hospital due to reduction of wbc count. She is treated for Rheumatoid arthretis and we suspect that it could be the side affects of rheumatoid medication. In recent test, It was found 760 wbc counts. Bone marrow test was conducted yesterday and we are waiting for the results. What is the next step? when will the blood count increase again?
output: Hi, Sorry to hear about your mother. Low WBC count could be due medicines like methotrexate given for rheumatoid arthritis. It could also be related to disease itself. Does she have any spleen enlargement? It usually takes a few weeks for the counts to recover. Till then, they would give her prophylactic medicines to prevent infections.

input: My boyfriend was punched a few times in the stomach about 3 days ago during a fight and he began having severe upper stomach pains 2 days later. He describes the pain as 2 knives stabbing him. He refuses to go to the E.R. so, I gave him a couple of Tylenol and he went to bed. The pain comes and goes in a 1-2 minute intervals and only lasts less than a minute. Is this pain a sign of internal damage and is there anything, other than Tylenol, that I can do for him at home?
output: Hi. Do nothing at home. The blunt injury causing such pain can very well indicate an internal problem with organs or bleeding or tear or so. Give him nothing orally. He needs to be investigated urgently to rule out serious problem.

The treatment for this is physiotherapy to release the nerve compression so may visit the nearby physiotherapist. Till the time you can have tabbed Neuronion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin and Diclofenac/Ibuprofen.

Is that normal or should I seek Medical Attention for it? If it is normal, how many days do you usually keep it?

input: I have had elevated AST / ALT levels (twice the high end of normal), low Alk. Phosphate , low sodium. Ultrasound clear, so was MRI, but trace amounts of ascites and two cysts found on liver. Tested for Hep. A, B, C, all clear. I do not have celiac but I think I have food intolerances to high fiber foods and have bad flatulence when I eat those things. Otherwise, pretty asymptomatic. What could be the problem? I hope I am not in the beginning stages of liver disease.
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for the query. Well, ascites indicates some significant liver disease, and you should try to find the exact cause which can be some autoimmune disorder, congenital liver disease, certain infections or metabolic diseases. You should do liver biopsy to rule this out.  Wish you good health. Regards

input: Does an ECG show up any potential heart problems. I had one last week for ectopic beats Ive been getting as a part of anxiety and it came back normal. I have had 3 in the last 8 years all normal. I had a weird sensation in my chest almost like my heart bubbled or flip flopped whilst I was vivid dreaming. Wondering whether I should be comforted by the recent ecg and its scaring me and making my anxiety worse.
output: ECG is the representation of your heart activity for that 30 seconds.  Like all test it helps us detect many problems of your heart, however like other test It's not always true. If at all you want to investigate for ectopic beats consider below. I'd the symptoms do occur every day, get a 24 hour holder.  If they are very rare once in a month or so and troublesome, an event recorder is a better investigation .  Before you embark of such a tedious job let me assure that 85% population has at some point of time in life ectopic s, however most 99% of there are benign and not relevant clinically, so you should be worried it there are no associated symptoms Regards

input: I have an ALT (SGPT) of 61, but my other Lever function tests are within normal ranges. Should I be concerned, or is my old physician right that it is no big deal? He is significantly older and seeming dismissive in general since I don t look sick.
output: Thanks for posting your concern on Chat Doctor! I appreciate your concern towards the high ALT (SGPT) level. Age, gender, problem for which ALT is advised, and its duration, alcohol intake if any are not mentioned. Normal Adult Range for ALT : 0 - 48 U/Therefore, ALT in your case is slightly elevated. So, as your old physician suggested you need not have to worry about it. You need to have some lifestyle modifications to reduce the level of ALT. Daily physical exercise, eat healthy balanced diet preferably fresh fruits and vegetables which contain several anti-oxidants that help in reducing the ALT, AVOID ALCOHOL if any, avoid fatty vegan and non-vegan meals, fast junk foods, take plenty of oral fluids. INSA Allah, in due course of time your ALT will be normal. Wishing you best of your health.

input: I have sharp, excruciating pain in my lower left side of my mouth from a bad tooth. Its the 2nd one from the back. It has a cavity in it. I had tried various home remedies to be rid of it, and nothing works. My funds are all but nothing, so I am worried a dentist may not help me....What can I do?
output: Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query. The pain could be because of the infection in the root tip of the tooth. The home remedies will not help. We have to treat the cause by treating the tooth with root canal treatment or extraction. Consult your oral physician and get radiograph done and start with the treatment. You can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics like penicillin and diclofenac(if you are not allergic). I hope my answer will help you. Take care.

input: HI I have depression from last 5 year. I am not able to find a job for me. Whenever I feel that I should get a job and apply for it I feel stressed out and I never apply for it. I feel traped,low sad and in fear whenever I think of applying for a job and feel that its not possible for me to attend an interview. Also I have sleep problems. I hardly get any sleep at night. Its sleepless nights and in the early morning I get a sleep of 5-6 hours. For this I have consulted a doctor and he has given me depran forte at night and I am using it since last 3 years. I get sleep almost at 3a.m. at night and wake up at 12 a.m. In morning. I take medicine at night around 9 p.m. although I have taken this medicine for 3 years I have not been able to apply for job until now as I still feel fear and I feel I cannot do it. Why is that the case still when I am taking medicine from last 3 years. Help me on this please.
output: I guess the dose of medicine is not enough for you. I wonder why your doctor did not increase the dose. Also I prefer using Escitalopram and clonazepam as separate medicine not as combination like you are taking. Escitalopram is the main medicine which will help you to get rid of all depressive symptoms including decreased sleep, fatigue,low mood etc. clonazepam should be used for only initial phase of treatment when restoration of sleep and decreasing anxiety are preferred goals. Onces Escitalopram starts showing its effect. Clonazepam should be tapered and stopped. As long term use of clonazepam may decrease your thought process. Hope this would help you

input: A friends family dog bit my daughters top lip today. It bled for less than a minute. I immeadiatly applied pressure with an ice pack and applied antibiotic ointment. It doesnt look deep at all. Lip is swollen. Dog is up to date on all vaccinations and rabies. Should I do something else?
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment and this is transmitted by dog bite. As your daughter was bitten by a vaccinated dog over the lip which has led to bleeding from the site, according to WHO it is categorized into Cat III. Even it is a vaccinated dog you need to doubly check whether it is properly and completely vaccinated, because the bite is on the lip which is closer to the brain and the virus can ascend easily and reach the brain and can affect it. So I would suggest you to take 1. Active immunization with antirabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.2. Passive immunization with Rigs around the wound.3. Oral antibiotic like Tab Augmenting, twice daily4. Topical Tract ointment.Don't take any risk with this disease, I would suggest your daughter to take aforementioned treatment. Thank you.

output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.

input: Yes.  Recently, Ive had 3 blood tests showing low WBCs and some other abnormal counts.  I sometimes take pamabrom when I feel bloated.  Could this cause leukopenia and neutropenia?  Im also definitely iron-deficient/anemic and that is being treated.  The low WBCs is still a mystery, though.

And how many times in a day? If I give her one day cerelac, one day banana,potato, other day fruits and repeat this whole week, along with breast milk, so this will be OK for her?

input: Hi doctor I have lost a stone in weight over the last month, last time I had any form of sex was around 8 months ago. Pregnancy test revealed i wasnt pregnant sfter doing snout 10 of them When I eat little my stomach feels full and is extremely bloated , constant aching stomach until I lay down. What could this possibly be
output: It sounds like stomach issue. All this is caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis, HERD or hiatus hernia. These disorders can cause such difficulties, and you should do gastrostomy to evaluate this. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of appetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward, stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee,smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise if overweight. Wish you good health.

input: My mom recently fell hard, hit her head and received 2 staples. The CT head/brain without contrast reads...Moderate white matter hypodensities are seen in the deep, periventricular and subcortical white matter with volume loss and old lacunar type infarcts in the basal ganglia. There is mild global volume loss. Chronic microangiopathic changes in the old lacunar type infarcts and mild global volume loss.
output: Hello, In relation to the fall that she took the CT scan doesn't show any damage due to the hit, none of those findings are related to the trauma, they were already present before she fell and hit her head. The findings are due to chronic changes in the brain matter and its blood vessels. Chronic microangiopathic changes are changes to the small blood vessels. To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates. So that finding depends a little on her age which you do not mention, the older she is, the more such volume loss is expected. The report speaks of mild volume loss so no reason for major concern on that regard, the blood vessel changes which I add

I can t see a doctor until at least next week but maybe you can help reassure me that it might be a benign condition. It s not near the bartholin s gland.

input: I have been in extreme pain from a brachial plexus nerve avulsion C 7,8 ,T1,2 and spi.since 2003.  The meds Ive been taking 3600 mg.Gab, 100 mg. Methadone, 40 mg. Baclofen and 30 mg. Cymbalta cover about 50% of the pain. My Pain Specialist has been pressuring me for years for a scs implant for years and I finally agreed, however I then find out I have to wait 1 year to see the Neurosurgeon. This is suppose to be the best pain clinic in Ontario St. Josephs Hospital London Ontario. Problem is all or most of the info from people on online forms who have spinal cord stimulator implants are not as positive as the Doctors. Do any Doctors available have any direct knowledge on this subject ?
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is unfortunate that you have been suffering from neuropathic pain for more than 10 years, and various pain medications have only partially helped you. I did not see pregabalin (lyrics) in your list of medications used. If that is the case, you can give pregabalin a try, as many people improve with that. Regarding spinal cord stimulator, it is an excellent option for pain control, however, just like other pain relief measures, it succeeds only in a proportion of patients. In the best pain centers, ACS implant may succeed in only about 60-70% of people. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

input: My husband had a ct of his chest and found there is calcified plaque within the thoracicaorta, proximal great vessels and coronary arteries, with ectasia of the ascending aorta to a diameter of 3.9 cm. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 11 mm short axis in the precarinal region. 10 mm short axis inferior the left mainstem bronchus and 11 mm posterior the right atrium. There is a lobulated masslike consolidation in the anterior right lung apex measuring up to 5.0X2.9X1.8 cm in maximal dimention. There is a 7mm subpleural lateral right middle lobe nodule and additional tiny subpleural nodule is present. Can you tell me what they are saying in laymen s terms?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the CT report you have mentioned. This report suggests that your husband is having lung infection. He is having right upper zone consolidation (pneumonia). So give him antibiotics and get done repeat chest x-ray to rule see if this consolidation is improving or not. If it is improving then no need to worry. But if it is static or worsening then possibility of mass (cancerous) is more likely. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks.

input: My father just started having dialysis after his creatinine level reached 15.4. Since then he also found blood in his urine. The doctors did cystoscopy today and found a tumor present. They said that they had removed the tumor and sent for some examination. They also said that if everything goes well, he will not have to undergo dialysis. Is this possible??? Till today, he has got 5 dialysis done.
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The need for dialysis depends on the clinical status of the patient and blood creatinine levels. Dialysis also depends on the underlying cause of raised creatinine levels. If the creatinine was high due to obstruction caused by bladder tumor, removal of tumor will reduce the creatinine levels. However, if the high creatinine level was due to primary kidney disease, the status of the kidneys has to be assessed to know the requirement of dialysis. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. 

input: Last Wednesday, a routine chest x-ray revealed what looked to be a 2 cm spot on upper left lung. I am a 40 year old female, non smoker who is asymptomatic. Had CT with contrast on Friday and it basically said the the image was nonspecific but i measured out to be 2.8 cm x 2 cm x 1.8 cm with opacity. It also said the lesion could be inflammation/infection but because I was asymptomatic, malignancy could not be excluded. What is the likelihood this is an infection or inflammation if I have no symptoms of chest cold, etc. Everyone in my home does have bronchitis right now though
output: No, a simple bronchitis cannot cause such a big lesion. However, as the size is 2.8 cm, It is very likely that it can be a cancer also. Get a biopsy done at the earliest and a PET CT scan if it turns out to be malignant. Secondly if it was an infection or inflammation, it would cause you some symptoms. Kindly vote thanks if the answer helped u

input: I am a female of 49 years. Suddenly my front portion of throat have swollen with a lump (approx 15cm radius) and on one side of the neck. Doctor advised me  certain blood and other tests to test forThyroid diseases. But reports came normal. This symtom has developed for the last three days. What could be the disease? I am on medicine for Arthritis for 10 years and have no major problems. Please help.
output: Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though your thyroid blood reports are within normal limits, still the swelling could be related to thyroid apart from other swellings of the neck. However, it might not be possible to diagnose the lump without a clinical examination, and a confirmatory test like an FNAC/core biopsy along with an ultrasound of the lump. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: Hi, my brother has dengue and his platelets count went on 93K when he was admitted. Next day count raised to 1.6K but now it has come to 43K on third day. Do I have to worry as he is hospitalised and seems doctors are not taking it serious. Please advice.
output: Hi, Sorry to hear about your brother and also appreciate your concern. The number of platelet count in dengue is of prognostic value;it means that it tells us how the disease is progressing and if platelet count has come down to 43K from 1.6K in one day, it should be followed up keenly although in my opinion a retest is a must. If it goes down further, he may need platelet infusion. Please talk to the doctor and keep an eye over the platelet count and the overall condition of your brother. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to ask another question if there is another query. Thanks, Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi there, I had an abscess drained about four weeks ago and my wound was packed. Have seen the nurse every few days and have been advised wound is fine and has healed. However since Saturday I have a hard lump attached to my scrotum and it is the same as previously had before drained. Can you advise what I should do? Is this normal for abscesses to come back so soon?
output: Thank you for your query. You are probably suffering from Sebaceous cyst of scrotum, which are getting secondarily infected, resulting in abscess formation. The infected ones are operated, as because they are multiple, and the symptomatic ones are left alone. Hot fomentation, local antibiotic ointment application and oral penicillin are the main stay of treatment. Please do also check your blood sugar levels, and ensure that you maintain personal hygiene. Take care and get well soon.

input: im 41 had two ablations for afib been normal rate for almost two years.have had several test on gastro side normal with gerd they say but lately have pains in left arm and chest that comes and goes with head aches bad sometimes pains last mins to hours my heart rate at rest is 65 blood pressure 137/81
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Your blood pressure and heart rate are normal, but since you are having history of atrial fibrillation and ablation, better to first rule out coronary artery disease as a cause for your left arm and Chest pain. So first get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

output: Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to overuse of the wrist due to activities.  I suggest using anti-inflammatory medications such as Acetaminophen to relieve the symptoms. I also suggest avoiding activities that overuse the wrist. Furthermore, I recommend using cold compresses for local application. Hope I have answered your query.

Bronchoscopy and culture are negative for infection like TB. So better to get done CENT thorax (CT scan with contrast). If this shows mass lesion then CT guided biopsy from the mass is needed forecourt diagnosis. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

She s has 2 sets of antibiotics which didn t do anything. She s also just finish a course of Azyter eye drops. These have changed the look of the cyst and it now looks more alive, angrier and bigger. The eye specialist that we saw last Monday, has booked my daughter in for surgery but this could take 2 months before a place comes up. We ve another appointment with him in 5 weeks. We are so so worried about her and really feel something needs to be done sooner. Please can you offer some advice. Many thanks, Fidelma.
output: Hi, It seems that she is having infected Albanian cyst giving this trouble. It requires excision and removal of cyst. Continue applying antibiotic cream after proper cleaning till you get appointment. If there is more infection, go for one more antibiotic medicine course. Ok and take care.

input: My daughter is 5 years old, she has never had this issue before but for the last 4 days when she wakes up in the morning as she is eating breakfast she throws up. After she throws up she will continue eating and will be fine for the rest of the day until the next morning. I dont know why this is happening, she is not running a fever nor is she complaining of stomach pains.
output: Our stomach secretes acid which helps in digestion. It is secreted throughout the day. Throughout the night, the acid gets collected. This acid irritates the inner lining of the stomach. So, in the morning when your child takes in the food, the already irritated gastric wall revolts, and she vomits out the contents of her breakfast. But in the process of digesting the breakfast, the gastric acid becomes utilized and such a situation does not arise till next morning. Hence, she remains fine throughout the day.

Im still in lot of pain as before and constantly feel like i need to use the bathroom for #2 but nothing. please help.

input: For the last year I have been having WBC with diff done every 3 months due to a high WBC of 19,000. This count has fluctuated throughout the year, but never been normal, also no illness to account for. I do have symptoms of fatigue, petechiae (hands, arms, and chest-occasionally), HTN, and some diarrhea. EKG from 5 years ago normal, LFT normal, CMP normal, Rheumatoid normal, kidneys normal. Been to an allergist and told I do have even more allergies, but would not account for the high WBC. Sed rate slightly elevated. Please advise. Jen
output: Hi and thanks for the question, Chronic elevation of the ABCs deserves a more critical evaluation. In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest carrying out Anti-nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and autism antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematous, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint. I suggest you book an appointment with the hematologist, to rule out a leukemia or any possible blood malignancy, and possibly systemic lupus erythematous. Thanks for your question and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD.

input: My dad is 86 with AF that is being managed with medication.  He has had a recent blood test that shows poor kidney function.  He has increasing symptoms of lethargy and is tired most of the time.  In the last while his appetite has gone and in the last two days had an episode of diarrhea and vomiting with some stomach pain.  Could he have kidney failure?.

input: I have two questions: I am 74 years old and am scheduled for rectacele surgery in January.  My family doc was hesitant to recommend the surgery.  After talking with my Urologist, he gave me the choice of surgery or living with the symptoms.  I had bladder suspension surgery in 2009.  Is there some danger here that I am not aware of?  I have opted to have the surgery based on my age and knowing that if it gets worse, surgery later on might be compromised by age and other factors that may or may not be present it at that time.Also, I am scheduled for a colonoscopy next week. Would it be advisable to wait to have the colonoscopy until after the rectacele surgery has healed?
output: Hi, You very well understand the fact that any surgery at this stage is considered risky and that is the reason you have been counselled in detail by your doctor. Colonoscopy is usually done prior to the surgery, hence it will be preferable to get it done now.

input: My wife had a left temporal bleed in May 2012, she was put on Levipil 500 mg BD, she discontinued it in August of 2013 - she got her first and only seizure on the 17th of october 2013. At that time we were traveling and could not get levipil but managed to get eptoin - she has been on 100 mg of eptoin 3 times a day for the last week. On seeing a neurologist I was advised to taper of the eptoin and start her on levipil as it is a safer drug. I cannot risk her having another seizure as she has suffered severe muscle damage in her back and legs from the seizure and is slowly recovering from it. Would it be ok to shift her to levipil?

input: My name is Tamara.  I am a 32 year old white female with class V membraneous lupus nephritis.  I also have multiple comorbidities including compartment syndrome in my lower extremeties with gross edema.  Recently, I have had boughts of severe swelling that results in massive water retention, to the extent of 40 pounds gained in less than a month.  While kidney function is fine during this increase and I can eventually pull off the fluid with crazy diuretic therapy, after the output, it seems that all of my muscles from mid calf to ankle are now hardened and very tender to touch.  I have waited several weeks in the hopes that the tissue would return to normal, but no avail.  What could have caused this, what condition is this called, and is there any way to reverse this as it is very painful (I doubt there is in my experience *I am an RN whos specialty is Renal Transplant/Nephrology* ).  Any information regarding this would be very much appreciated so that I can continue on this side.  That you!  Tamara.

output: Hi Carmen Chat Doctor. It looks that you have got colitis. A proper history, clinical examination, investigations as per these findings alone can lead to a proper diagnosis. This is most important to lead to a proper management/ treatment. So visit a Doctor, preferably general surgeon. All you need is a 5-day course of antibiotic, metronidazole and supportive medicines, and you will be fine. Do not panic and do not think this as a serious problem.

output: Hi! Thanks for sharing your health problem with Chat Doctor! After going through your problem of knee pain with lump on the top, I would like to consider following possibilities AS PER MY ROUTINE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:1. Benign cystic conditions like bursa, ganglion cyst etc. possibility 60% 2. Inflammatory like synovitis, synovial herniation, patellar dislocation, synovial effusion etc., possibility 20%3. Benign solid tumor or tumor-like conditions like giant cell tumor, lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma, cysts possibility 20%Therefore, it could be a cause for worries in the future!. And you must confirm the diagnosis by ultrasonography and needle biopsy as advised by your doctor and thereafter discuss with him the possible treatment options.

input: hi my name is juliaI have 2.5 yrs old boy he had temperature at 7pm 101.4f.  I gave him 4cc chilren tylenolthen I gave him another dose at 9.15pm 4cc his temperature droped to96.7f and last one at12 midnight and his temp now is 96.4 ist ok he had a case of ceasure at age 1
output: You can safely use Tylenol in the prescribed dose 4-5 times a day for a child who is running fever. However, it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock, and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F. Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible. Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past, don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F. I hope that helps. Best wishes.

input: Hello, my grandma is 71 turning 72 in July. She is basically in the end stages of liver failure. She had a tube that was drain excess fluid but she pulled it out because she was frustrated. Now she has a chest tube that is draining all the fluid because her lung collapsed. Her voice was going away for the past couple days but now it is completely gone. Is this associated with the liver failure or is there another explaination?
output: Welcome at Chat Doctor !!  I have gone through your case and being your physician I completely understand. Your health concerns... Based upon the history you have provided it is rather difficult to pinpoint the diagnosis since your grandma has the variety of issues. End stage liver disease do presents with loss of speech that is called HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY grade 4...... It is the most common cause of loss of speech in chronic liver disease.  Second probability is hypoxia leading to carbon dioxide retention leading to acid base imbalance that too provokes hepatic encephalopathy and also one of cause of loss of speech.  You better take her to hospital so that appropriate workup has been done, and proper management should be provided to her.  May she get well soon, if u still have any query feel free to ask anytime regards Chat Doctor.

input: Hi! I have extremely dry skin where my two butt cheeks meet, like in the crack of my butt. It itches terribly, and often leaves a burn of flakey dry skin in my underwear. I know that I have psoriasis on my scalp. I was just wondering if it can affect my butt cheeks and also my genital area? I ve had vaginal itch since I was young. Yeast infection medicines dont work, rarely will an anti-itch cream work. It was localized on one side of my vagina for 10 years and had since spread to both sides. My family doctor just says to use anti-itch, but I think there s a bigger issue or a better answer. The left (original) side had turned a darker color and is thicker. What exactly could be the issue?
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor Psoriasis is a likely possibility as it can very well involve the body folds. Psoriasis classically involves the extensors like scalp, elbows, knee, shins and lower back, but sites like maxilla, groin folds can also be involved either together with the extensors or solely, where it is classically known as inverse psoriasis would advise that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g. cetirizine would help you symptomatically with the itch. Regards

input: I have a slightly elevated liver enzymes, very low vitamin d. My thyroid checks out fine. im fatigued, hair loss, dry skin. I also had a vaginal biopsy and they found hyperplasia . Is the liver enzymes and low vitamin d related. the doctor said not to worry about the liver enzymes. she put me on 50,000 units of vitamin d.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Liver enzymes might be elevated due to disease and this can lead to reduced synthesis of vitamin D. It will help to know by how much your liver enzymes are raised and then treat any condition that is causing it. Since the doctor has told not to worry therefore I think the liver enzymes are not very high to cause a concern. However, you might have vitamin D deficiency and this requires you to take supplement. The pap smear showing hyperplasia requires discussion with the pathologist. Hyperplasia itself does not indicate cancer but might be a precancerous stage. You might vitamin D for now. Please do not worry.

output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign cyst like Desmond cyst.  Or you may have some soft tissue tumor like lipoma or neurofibroma. You should dot wait because it doesn't look like inflammatory lesion. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: Hi I am 30 yrs old and my husband is 33. We are planning for a baby since 2.5 yrs . In Oct 2010 we got to know that i am having a cyst which was constantly present for 8-9 mionths and our gyn said that it might be a chocolate cyst and endo. So we had laproscopy done in Sep 2011 and after that tried for iui for 5 months but unsuccessful. Then our gyn said to go for IVF wherein we still are thinking as it is very expensive. We went to another doctor in March 2012 and she prescribed Lupron depot inj for 3 mths and I got my mensus in Aug 2012..I want to know what are the chances to conceive with endo and should i wait for sometime and try iui or what else can be done..please help..Regards Neha
output: Hi, As you have already tried 5 cycles of GUI after laparoscopy, it's better to try for treatment which gives better pregnancy rate which is IVF. As you have already received In Lu pron Depot for 3 months, it would have been better to go for IVF immediately after 3rd dose of Lu pron as it increases chances of pregnancy in IVF. But still It's not too late. You can go for IVF straightforwards or can again take Lu pron depot for 1-2 months & then go for IVF. IVF is definitely the best treatment for you. Wish you good health.

input: my mom s blood pressure over the last hour has been very low, mostly the bottom number. the last reading was 145 over 64 but was as low as 51 on the bottom number. her question is should she take her blood pressure medicine as normal. She s kinda worried it may make it drop in the night too low.
output: Hi Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Yes she certainly needs to continue her blood pressure medications. Low number of the denominator need not be worry at the moment. All she need is good HY Chat Doctor. Reduction of daily salt intake to less than 6 gm/day will help. Monitor the blood pressure daily over 2 weeks to adjust adequate dosage. I advise you to have a baseline 2D echo and ECG on semi-annual basis for better cardiac assessment. Consult an expert cardiologist for further help. Post your further queries if any. Thank you.

input: I have been experiencing cold rushes down my left leg from time to time.  I do have five hyrneated discs in my lowerback for over forty years.  When that happens my leg sometimes goes numb briefly, nothing has to be going on at the time that happens. I had hip surgery on my right hip three years ago with a replacement hip.  The problem with my leg is with my left leg and started after the surgery. It causes no discomfort at this time but, Im just wandering if this is a precusor to what may be to come.I am a sixty- six year old woman, retired and in fairly good health. I am a make up of many cultures.and tat
output: Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your problem in the left leg is no way related to your Hip replacement surgery of the right hip. As per the description, all your symptoms suggest a degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine witChatDoctorpression of the neural elements. The conservative management of degenerative disc disease is as follows -* avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back* avoid forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion* Use a lumbosacral back support to augment your spinal muscles* Intermittent pelvic traction to cause a regression of disc* Maintain optimum body weight, if you are obese* Physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.* Judicious use of analgesics and muscle relaxants. If all these measures fail to provide you relief, then surgical decompression may be an option. Hope this information is helpful. Good day

output: Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor I went through your history & it suggests that you are suffering from Peritonitis i.e. inflammation of periodontal tissue before eruption of third molar. It occurs due to food lodgment & bacterial accumulation in that area. Its Symptoms are:- -pain -swelling -difficulty in mouth opening -fever -malaise -regional lymphadenopathy Get an IOP AR done & consult your dentist. If flap is interrupting in its path then go for flap removal i.e. operculumectomy. Otherwise, if sufficient space is not available then go for extraction since it is vestigial & has no role in mastication. For temporarily relief do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day. Start with Tab Amclaid-625 twice a day along with Tab Aerosol -SP thrice a day for 5 days. In Case of gastric problem take rabeprazole-40 mg once daily. Your herbal pills won't be of much use. Do Betadine gargles twice a day.  Take Care Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: I have been a ocd sufferer for over a decade now i did not know of it for many years but later on underwent therpy for close to 2 yrs i was prescribed F-tin along with certain occupational therapies And it helped to certain extent but came a time when i realised that no pill is cut out for my specific forms of symptoms & i stopped Now the prolem is that though i am aware of my problems but can not help much Actually its hampering my studies by making my productivity low  I have been trying a lot but pl tell what should i do as per your insight
output: Hi, I can understand your distress and concern, specifically since you are able to attain much benefit with treatment. OCD can be occasionally difficult to treat, but with right approach, can be dealt with effectively. Had I been your treating psychiatrist, I would have considered treatment with medications from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine or sertraline together with behavior therapy in form of exposure and response prevention. Depending on the initial response to the 1st medicine tried, further course like adding clomipramine or an atypical antipsychotic like risperidone, etc. can be tried. You can discuss regarding these option with your psychiatrist. I am sure that with adequate treatment, you will respond well and get better. I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

output: Hi, Are you applying any over the counter face cream?  Steroid containing over the counter creams may cause redness and rashes on face. Allergic reaction to hair also may present with swollen eyes. Superficial bacterial infection of skin such as erysipelas can also cause similar rash.

input: So my boyfriend and I were messing around. We had a condom on, and I was on top (Sorry for information ). However, he had already ejaculated... he still had that condom on while I was on top on of him. There was No penetration throughout everything . I was just like rubing the outside of my vagina on his penis ... now my period is late. Almost a week.... Could I be pregnant? Please help...
output: Hello dairy understand your concerned have non-penetrative sex and used condoms rubbing of the penis with condom on it does not cause pregnancy. To become pregnancy penetrative unprotected sexual intercourse in the fertile phase of the period is required. So there is no chance of the pregnancy. Your period can be delayed due to hormonal imbalance, ovarian dysfunction, excessive stress, change in lifestyle and dietary habitat for the period for next 4-6 days. If period will not come then consult the gynecologist and period can be induced by the progesterone pillMeanwhile avoid stress, take healthy diet, Chat Doctor.

How can I treat my Axillary hyperpigmentation?
output: Hi............. axillary hyperpigmentation can occur due to friction with tight clothing(as mentioned by you)Even the use of deodorants and antiperspirants can cause it waxing.shaving, or hair removal creams can cause IIT can be post inflammatory after a bacterial or a fungal infection To treat this peeling- TCA peels or glycol or mixed peels can be done apply segmenting creams like comic acid or glycolic acid or HY Chat Doctor.

input: My husband is 36 years old.he smokes 4, 5 times a day.his sperm count is 100 percent but his sperm motility rate is 50 percent only.is this motility rate okay?we have not been able to conceive for the last one year.my all reports are fine.Mona Sharma age-32 years
output: Hi, Normal sperm motility is considered to be greater than 50 percent. When the motility falls between 25-50 percent on a single ejaculate, this may not reflect a real problem. When the motility consistently falls below 25 percent, the chances of a problem are much higher. When the motility consistently falls below five to 10 percent, the chances that fertility is normal is highly unlikely. However, you should not worry as your husband has sperm motility of 50 percent which can be taken as normal.

input: My father had right sided Brain hemorrhage and was operated for SDH and ICH because of fatal road accident. He is taking Leviteracetam since that accident and at present he is recovered well except some problems with memory. He is having some hallucinations and psychiatric behaviour, does leviteracetam causes such side effects?? In our last meeting with the neurologist, he had started Oxcarbamazepine. Current Medications : Leviteracetam 500 mg BID Oxacarbamazepine
output: Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It is very difficult to predict these symptoms like memory loss, hallucination and psychiatric behavior whether due to Hemorrhage or Levitaracetam.A few people who take Leviteracetam for any condition (may experience depression, suicidal thoughts/attempts, or other mental/mood problems. Brain hemorrhage also cause the similar symptoms even after recovery. In brain hemorrhage, the complete recovery is very rare, and the patient may have symptoms occasionally or regularly.Thus, to find the cause thorough neurological examination is vital. If the neurological examination is normal, then switch over to other Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.

Findings are consistent with lymphangitic carinomatosis and mestatic pulmonary nodules.No infiltrate, mass or consolidation seen in either lungNo evidence of pleural effusion.No evidence ofbilar. mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.The vascular and bony structures are normal.

input: My 33 y.o. daughter woke with severe upper abdominal pain, frequent urination, burning in her stomach that radiates to the back and pain upon swallowing. I realize we need to see a physician but I was hoping for a little insight as to what this might be. At this time we have no transportation and young children that need tending. Would you please let me know what we could be facing?
output: Hello, The symptoms may be due to urinary tract infection. In this situation I would advise my patient for urinalysis and urine culture and sensitivity. If there is evidence of infection than a course of antibiotics will be prescribed. Antispasmodic alone will do to manage the pain if there is no infection.

input: Hello Doctor My child having 3years suffering from frequent fever from 15 days due to swollen glands on the neck .our doctor prescribed us delcon plus , new deletusP syrups and nutocef50 tablets ...is this a proper prescription even though he is getting fever for every six hours severely..please prescribe proper medicine. Thank-you Swaroopa.
output: Hi... Recurrent fever with swollen glands in the neck for the past 15 days could be ABV infection or otherwise called infectious mononucleosis. It is a self limiting prolonged viral illness. Rarely it can cause complications. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards - 

input: I am 34 years old I have a acidity problem for last 6 years I have used lot of medicine but stil in a same position I lost my weight also I did my ultrasound test report showing that my liver is little bit big and lot of gas in my stomach and lower part of the abdomen . When I use medicine I am feel better and when I stop to eat medicine it starts, kindly advise me medicine .
output: Dear .... Many thanks for the mail. A slightly big liver usually does not mean anything serious unless the liver function tests show some abnormal readings. So an LFT needs to be done. Like wise ultrasound evidence of gas in the stomach also does not mean anything. You will require an endoscopy test if not already done and I need to know the report. If you feel better while you take medicine denotes that you have some acidity problem. I suggest you continue the same medicine till you send me the reports I asked for. Taking these medicines for a long period of time will not cause any harm. Rgards

input: How is it that a medical expert could use the 1990 ACOR criteria for Fibromyalgia in July of 2009, when was the preliminary available? I don t have any money, I am now disabled and not working, I need help and some answers. Is this questionnaire set up to help or to make money? Sorry about the attitude but I am tired of trying to find the truth about my case and because I am unable to make the living that I once made because of the Fibro, I am left in the dark.
output: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also, in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy, meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain, but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

input: Hi,Im a 30 year old woman, Ive always been healthy but I have this problem since my 20s. Whenever Im nervous, anxious, emotional, really unhappy about something or really happy about something, I start sweating, my chest and neck become very hot and red blotches appear mainly in my chest very rapidly. Is is very disturbing in social situations. What can I do to solve this problem? Thanks
output: Blushing is a common reaction. It may be a part of social anxiety disorder or social phobia. If blushing, sweating, along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you negatively when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking, talking to a crowd, or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive, but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality, that it stays throughout life. However, medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrists' opinion on it.

Parts of the day I feel normal & then the heart burn creeps up on the random. I feel lost, no sense in reality, low energy, & I start to get quiet. Most of the say I feel like im dieing slowly.
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Coming to this point (facing your actual complains and overall clinical scenario), I strongly recommend you to consult immediately the nearest ER service in your living area, as those cocktails (MDMA, weed, alcohol, etc.) are very dangerous for your health, especially for your heart. They may exacerbate form mild blood pressure fluctuations, to serious arrhythmias, sudden heart attack, and even cardiac arrest and death. So, do not lose any more time, but ask medical help, to undergo a careful physical exam, resting ECG, several lab tests (like complete blood count, CK-MB, troponin, AST & ALT, renal function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.), and rule out serious health conditions, as well as start an appropriate therapy for your health status. I strongly recommend you to avoid having such dangerous substances in the future, to protect your health and life. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! 

input: I am experiencing a right side dull pain in my temple and at times sharp. My right side cheeks and face feels kinda tender when touched. I know I have been experiencing headaches and neck pains as well. Im just concerned due to a previous aneurysm on right side in back of my head lower to neck.
output: Hello, I can understand your concern. It is logical that you can assume it to be aneurysm again as you have had it before. However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc. What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any loci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems. By the time you see a doctor, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Motorola 10 mg up to thrice day to have relief from pain. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,

But I still can t explain why it happens in the first place. Thank you for your help. It is very appreciated. - elaine silverman
output: Hi Elaine, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. No, hemochromatosis does not cause difficulty to walk. 2. I am not sure if it is anything related to hemochromatosis as you can walk at nights and not in day. Are you able to move your limbs during daytime? If you are able to move any of the limbs, then you will require psychological support and counseling.3. Routine hologram along with serum iron investigations will give a guide on hemochromatosis. Liver biopsy can confirm it. If more details are available regarding investigations and clinical history, I can be more helpful. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

I have an apoinment with my obgyn Monday to have the mirena checked. Is it okay to wait that long of should I seek immediate attention?
output: Hallow, I fully empathize your sufferings. Mirena is an intrauterine device. When with IRENA in you start getting severe pain in abdomen, the cause could be:1. The uterus cannot get adjusted with it and is trying to throw it out. This is more commonly observed in women without any previous pregnancy.2. There is infection in the uterus and the device.3. The device is trying to perforate through the uterus. You will have to report to the Gynecologist at the earliest. Ultrasonography/X-ray can reveal about the perforation aspect. Rest two will have to be evaluated by the Gynecologist by clinical examination. You may have to get the device out if it is not tolerated by you. If there is infection, you may require a course of antibiotics. I hope I have guided you with sufficient information.

input: Hi, what is the name of the muscle/tendon/ligament/structure that is very thin on either side behind the knee. You can feel it. I have pain there and felt it pull a few weeks ago. Now I also have pain in front of the knee but this was the start of it so I m wondering what it is.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. These structures are called hamstrings. These are semitendinosus and semimembranosus. For pain, you can take analgesic such as ibuprofen. Vitamin B and C help in recovery. For details about injury you can get MRI of knee joints. You can discuss with your doctor about it.

input: I ve had a white coating on my tongue that tastes chalky when I scrape it off for 2 months at least. I ve been through all the tests and have been told that the culture result shows definitively no sign of yeast or strep bacteria, both respiratory and oral smear. I went it after noticing my breath was not good. I have a PDA so I have very strict oral health. I was on antibiotics for many years, 100mg Doxycycline 2x daily for acne. The initial thought was thrush. It is not the case. My boyfriend now has it, he developed it about 2 days after the bad breath. The white does scrape off and looks a bit like shaggy white carpet.
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The white chalky coating on the tongue can be because of the food debris, or it can be because of hyperplasia of the papillae. Nothing to be panic consult an oral physician and get it evaluated to rule out hairy leukoplakia. The bad breath can be because of the gum infection secondary to deposits, or it can be because of the food lodgment secondary to decay, or it can also occur in respiratory or gastrointestinal tract diseases. Consult an oral physician and get all this thing ruled out, get your teeth cleaned and use mouth wash like chlorhexidine. Once the cause is found out consult respective physician and get it treated. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: Okay so the past two months I have missed my first birth control pill, I finally got back on track this month and I am 10 days into the packet. I had intercourse last tuesday and have been feeling more than off. Nausea, fatigue, headaches, slightly sore breasts, cramping, a bittle bit of being emotional, dehydrated. Just all out deeling horrible. Ive taken pregnancy tests but I feel it could be too soon. And would I be feeling these pregnancy symptoms so soon after? Also, could it just be that I am finally back on my bc regimen?
output: Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Irregular intake of birth control pill & unprotected sex close to your fertile period or ovulation day (occurs 14 days prior to due date) are quite risky for being pregnant. In this case, I suggest you to undergo one home pregnancy test if you miss your next period. Above clinical features are quite relevant with possible pregnancy. Common symptoms of pregnancy:a) Missed period, nausea, vomiting, tender and swollen breast.b) Increased frequency of urination, fatigue, food craving.c) Slight vaginal spotting, cramping, mood swing, constipation etc. Hope, I have answered your query. Good luck and take care.

input: I am 62. A year and a half ago I had a bad virus...afterwords I had very painful stiff muscle pain. Doctor has given me pregabalin and co-codamol. My neck and right arm are very still and my right arm has pain. My left arm can get stiff but not as bad. I exercise every day and keep myself active. Also I am overweight. I now find myself slowing down and I am aware my muscles are not very strong. Why after all the medication am I not getting better? The overall muscle pain is better but the pain and stiffness in my right arm is getting worse.

Regular neck isometric exercises can help.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Greetings from Chennai. By what you quote I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever? If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing, and I suggest you meet a pediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. By what you quote it should be an urticaria or a simple skin allergy. You can use HY Chat Doctor.  Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine, but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your pediatrician. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

input: I have high BP and recently prescribed a water pill, low dose hydrochlorizaide, I have been suffering from dizziness and think it may be low potassium, I feel better after I have eaten a banana and some electrolye drink, such as Gatorade or Vit Water. The dizziness only lasts till afternoon, so I think it must be dietry related?
output: Hi, first I want to know whether you are a diabetic or not. If you are a diabetic and on insulin or oral medicine then it may be due to hypoglycemia. The dizziness may be due to thiamine induced hypotension (excessive fall of BP). Low potassium and sodium can happen with thiamine intake, but less likely with lower doses. Next time please check your BP when you feel dizzy, and also get serum sodium and potassium level done. If the dizziness is due to excessive fall of BP then better take the medicine at bedtime. Thanks

input: Hi Im 31 years old and I had two mcs one in 2010 and the next on 2011. After the second I found that I have the v leiden factor and I m on baby aspirin since then. I also found that my AMH antimullerian hormone is at 1,76 that belongs to low fertility . My fsh was at 7.8 .I m ovulating in every cycle on the 13day. I tryed with menopur and pregnyl to conceive again for 5 cycles but with no result. My last try was on last December. Two months later my thyroid levelsf for tsh found increased at 3,64 they were dropped at 0.00 and now TSH is on 0.35. Do you believe it is unable to conceive on my own? Should I go on an ivf when my thyroid is regulated? It has been over a year that I havent conceive and that makes me worry.
output: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. Since you are having a normal ovulation on day 13 in every cycle, you can conceive normally once the thyroid levels have been normalized. Please do not worry. Conception is a time taking process and needs patience. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

input: Is ventorlin good for child cold and cough ?hi,my 11yearS 4months old daughter was prescribed ventorlin syrup.ventorlin 5 ml 6 HOURLY ONCE times 7days ,she was first having cold with runny and blocked nose.i just wanted to know that dr.prescribed her a correct medication or not because ventorlin is a bronchodilator?it will have any side effect or not?she had no wheezing.it is dry coughing i think.
output: Ventolin (Albuterol) is a bronchodilator and your doctor has prescribed it because often in case of such cough, bronchospasm occurs. He has not prescribed the wrong medicine. But if you feel that she does not have wheezing, you may skip giving it and reserve if for times of respiratory distress, if it occurs. The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough. The cold has been caused by a viral infection and generally takes 5-7 days to recover. Please be patient till then.

output: He will likely need to stay in the hospital for several days after the ventilator is discontinued. He can be assessed by physical and occupational therapists to help with the determination of whether 24 hour care will be required. At this age and with such a weak heart, he will likely need significant assistance.

input: My son has been getting a rash periodically when we take him to the doctor with it they think it is viral. But he keeps getting them. I just cant see a virus lasting for years off and on. It doesnt flake, puss, or create any pimples. It is only on his face and it will spread all over his face. What could this be
output: Hi and welcome to ChatDoctorGiven that the rash is periodic, it is more in favor of an allergy. It could be atomic dermatitis, basically allergic causing rashes over the face, in the creases and also other body folds. Did he have similar complaints from a very young age? It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear, apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor. To confirm you can consult a dermatologist and run tests to check allergy levels in blood, also skin tests for possible causes. Hope this helps.

input: Dear sir,Recently my Father-in-law(FIL) saw the Heart doc for ByPass related surgery. Doctor suggested to go for "Ultra Sound Abdomen" and "Dopler study of renal arteries" first as my FIL has very high BP(200/100).  "Ultra Sound Abdomen" report says "Inter Polar cyst measuring 12 MM noted in the right kidney" and "Prostatomegaly". I am worried, what does it mean?  Your guidance is highly appreciated.Thanks In Advance
output: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Cyst in the kidney and high blood pressure is suggestive of the damage caused by the high blood pressure. High blood pressure in the kidney can cause damage on the renal calyxes and can cause cyst. It requires surgical correction. Further management of the blood pressure can also prevent further damage to the kidney. Prostatomegaly means enlarged prostate. Enlarged prostate usually occurs with being prostatic hypertrophy. This needs to be confirmed with the PSA level in the blood. It will be higher on the carcinoma of the prostate. If its carcinoma it needs to be managed as per the malignancy. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor.

output: Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. This sore throat is probably not related to the PICC line and this could have occurred because of your low immunity levels due to the cancer. As you are already on antibiotics, you don't need to worry about it. If there is swelling or redness at the site of the PICC line, then you need to visit a doctor and get is changed.

I can now feel a small bump on my upper lip near the teeth. What could it be? (Im seeing my dentist today after I though I could deal with the pain)Thanks,
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The possible cause of plan is because of the tooth infection. The type of pain what you are getting is characteristic feature of pulpits. The lump could be because of the abscess formation. The normal filling will not solve the issue. The tooth has to be treated with RCT or extraction. Take a radiograph to rule out the infection. You can take a course of antibiotics like penicillin and metronidazole combination after consulting the physician. I hope my answer will help you. Take care

input: last night while eating an orange I started to choke.  Iwas coughing quite hard and then I could not get an air. My chest was suddenly very painful and the pain radiated down both my arms. I blacked out and when I came to the orange piece was on the rug beside my mouth and the pain was gone.  What happened to me.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out, wind pipe is open, and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: I have just had a piece of tissue removed from upper gum due to bad fitting dentures a large mass of excess tissue has grown,  dentist wants to biopsy it before going ahead and removing it all. He put in some stiches and said they would dissolve. I am worried because of language barrier, I am in Taiwan. I am healthy 50yrs old woman. any help would be great.  Thanks
output: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Excess tissue growth with ill-fitting denture as you have described is usually harmless referred as Ellis fissuratum. This is usually cause by chronic tissue irritation by an ill-fitting dentures and its response to the soft tissue. Biopsy is usually done to rule out any other lesions including neoplasm. I would suggest you to go ahead with surgical removal of the tissue. After the healing get a new denture done with proper fitting and proper maintenance of the denture. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

His heart condition is weak functioning at 10 percent, what are his chances of survival and if not much how long does he have.

Unfortunately no doctor can absolutely accurately predict how long any patient would live but his doctors with daily knowledge of his blood tests and examination findings would be in a better position to determine his prognosis. I hope this helps

I wake up in the morning feeling ok, wanting so badly to get coffee in my system. My diet is in check and I exercise regulary,. Im not over weight. 6ft 160lbs. The issue is, after aprox 1030ish, I feel like I want to crash. I become irratble and really sleepy almost like im on some downer. At night my wife comes home and Im like get ready for bed im exhausted. She asked if I was depressed due to being so snapy and wanting to sleep. Im no doctor but, I would bet my money on the low t. I hear of a lot of men getting prescribed androl and other suplements but my doctors shut the door on me. I cant afford the private HRT to many kids. Can someone let me know what type of doctor I should go see, if my range is low enough that I should receive help. Seems like I keep running into a brick wall when I ask the doctor.Also, if I cant get help throuh the doctors do over the counter test boosters really work or is it a waste of money?

input: Age-28,Height-5.5,weight-73,i miscarage of 2 months in Jan 10 due to not aware of such.Planning for last 6 months but not yet conceive.Periods are regular cycle of 30 days consulted doctor this month itself she has prescribed the Folic acid and productive F to me and productive M to my husband.Plz help would this will result in positive and i conceived this months or what treatment i should go for.
output: Hi, I think you should take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound. Only productive M and F and folic acid will not work.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months. You can do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels just to rule out any other problem. Hope I have answered your question.  If you have any other query I will be happy to help.

Not sure how I feel about taking prescription anything but what about natural herbs from an acupuncturist?

output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Asthma is normally associated with Chat Doctor.  Some persons may only have the cough. It is not likely, based on the symptoms that you mentioned, that asthma is the cause. Chest pain can be due to any structure in the chest from the skin inwards.

output: Hello, Oral contraceptive pill has some side effects like irregular period or bleeding, headache/ migraine, nausea/ vomiting, breast tenderness, fatigue, irritability, decreased libido, weight gain & mood changes.

input: Hi there I am a 25 year old male. I aim to keep healthy and eat well however lately have been noticing that I am frequently mildly short of breath, even when at rest. It can be at various points during the day and for no real apparent reason and frequently causes me to yawn, feel tired or have limited concentration. Sometimes I feel so tired and almost wheezy that my voice sounds different... almost as if its not getting all the air it usually does behind it. When I was around 14 my parents often told me they thought I may have asthma, however this was never diagnosed and I mostly just ignored it as it wasn t too noticeable to me. 8 Years ago I went for a routine check up and the Doctor mentioned that I had a heart murmur. Again it was never fully looked at as never really noticed it (except for the odd flutter now and again which I considered normal). Now recently i ve been noticing that I m short of breath more frequently, daily even. So I went to the hospital for an unrelated matter last week and whilst was there thought id mention all the above. The shortness of breath has seemed to have affected my confidence lately. They gave me a pre-operative ECG and noticed that it had an incidental RBBB on the charts. Therefore, my question is whether there a chance that these symptoms could all be connected and what might that reason by? Could the murmur, RBBB and mild shortness of breath all be completely separate or possibly something more serious? I know you cant diagnose as such, however i m just looking for thoughts whilst I await an appointment with the Doctor. For info, whilst in hospital my resting pulse rate was 69 (although i ve noticed that can be about 75 at rest on other occasions), and my BP was 129 over 89 at rest which I think is normal. Many thanks
output: Hello, Right, Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a common finding in many young patients. The Heart murmurs may be normal in a young patient too. Shortness of breath and change in voice may be from the heart or lungs. I recommend you thorax radiography and echocardiography. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  

input: i had tonsillitis with some bronchitis almost 4 to 5 weeks ago and i still get a cough every now an them from laughing or running but i dont smoke but in the past i been around smokers also i took antibiotics and i am pretty sure i dont have asthma considering this never happened to me before.
output: Hello, thank you for posting your query in Chat Doctor. Passive smoking has harmful effects same as the smoking that cause health hazards. Tobacco smoke contains 200 to 4000 toxic chemicals including nicotine, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde which cause heart diseases, lung diseases like bronchitis, asthma, middle ear infections, tonsillitis and symptoms like cough, sore throat, nose irritation. If I were your treating doctor I would like to get these tests done.1. Blood tests to rule out infections2. Chest x ray3. ECG to rule out cardiac causes. I would come up with following possibilities like asthma, bronchitis, I would suggest you to consult a pulmonologist for further evaluation.  Wish you good health.

input: My mother was told, after having brain scan, that she has some calcification on her frontal lobe. She has to go in for another scan soon. We are wondering what kinds of things (diseases/conditions etc) could be diagnosed? The doctored seemed to change the subject, clearly wanting to wait (understandably) for another test.
output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. There are different brain lesions that may have as their part calcifications. These include low grade glial tumors, benign Meningiomas, cavernous (vascular malformation), or may be simple calcifications of brain parenchymal related to age. Cerebral MRI with gadolinium is needed to evaluate the true nature of the lesion. Hope this helps. If you have further questions feel free to ask.

input: I believe I am 5 weeks pregnant and have been taking tetrasyl for several months. We had IVF to conceive our first child so did not believe it was possible to fall pregnant naturally otherwise I would not have carried on taking tetrasyl. How dangerous is this to our unborn child? Very concerned and would appreciate some advice.
output: Hi there,Tetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy, but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: I have a 39 year old son, who 6 weeks ago had a lower wisdom tooth removed. He now has bad painin his lower front 2 or 3 teeth and sometime only one and under his tongue. sometimes tip of tongue burning.he has been back to dentist twice, and to 2 oral surgeons, one numbed his front teeth, and alvorie and lingualnerve to try to find out where pain was coming from, he hit the lingual nerve with needle, said it was up higherthan normal, said the alvore nerve looked ok from x ray, Cant find any one to diaganose problem with mri or anything, no one knows what to do, other than give pain killers, ambient to sleep, steroids, he still cant sleep for the pain.Help!
output: Hi, it appears that the pain is only due to the infection. The removal of the wisdom tooth is a lumbar some process, with the breaking of the alveolar margin of the jaw bones, which may damage the nerves and vessels of the jaw. It also may be due to pressure on the trigeminal nerve, so it may cause trigeminal neuralgia. So I advise you to consult a neurologist for diagnosis.  I to my patient with such symptoms prescribe ofloxacin, ornidazole, serratiopeptidase, and anti-inflammatories. Thank you.

input: I ve been experiencing sensations as if my brain is shaking inside. When this happens, I ve noticed that my vision is clearly moving in a rapid up and down motion. I had an MRI and CT and EEG, an there were no adnormalities. I have also been diagnosed with Vertigo resulting from the inner ear.
output: Hello, You may have a condition known as OSCILLOPSIA which refers to fields of vision that are in motion with head movements.  The underlying pathological mechanism involves a loss of image stabilization by loss of reflex control of eye muscle control when a person has their gaze fixated.  Things such as toxicity, infection (most importantly meningitis) or side effects from antibiotics can cause the condition.  Desalinating disease such as MS can also cause this condition, as well as abnormal movements of the eyes referred to as nystagmus. I recommend you seek an opinion from a NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIST.  Vertigo from inner ear problems will not produce this phenomenon. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi Doctors But My name is ronald im masturbate this last year maybe 2 times a days Still now i masturbate 2 times a week but i wanna know why my left Forarm Muscles and Chest Muscles Is unbalanced And the Right Side of my body is larger how it is happen or what is the cure for it?

input: Hi i got kicked by a horse 3 days ago my elbow. Its still swollen and it hurts to touch. I can move it in all directions but does hurt when doing so and is stiff. My lower arm ( just under the elbow) aches aswell if i dont keep busy and takes me a while to get to sleep be ause of the achey pain. Could i maybe have a hairline fracture.
output: Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The lump on your elbow could be due to collection of blood caused by the kick by the horse. This would normally get absorbed in a few days if there is no more active oozing. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Also, a cold compress and rest to the elbow with a supporting sling would add to hastening of the improvement. If it persists or the pain increases, I would then advise you to consult an orthopedic surgeon in your area for a possible radiological investigation and further management. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: Hi I have something hanging off the inside part of my upper lip in front of my front two teeth . It is hanging superficially and I noticed it a couple days ago, but it has become more prominent. It is nonpainful, easily move-able, and is flat, smooth and kind of circular. When I left my lip it I can see it pretty clear, I thought it seemed cystic but I am not sure anymore. Please let me know what it could be. I brush regularly but havent dont anything else to it.
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor. It could be a granuloma or a papilloma. All conditions are self regressing and you don't have to worry. Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately. If papilloma or granuloma increases in size and interferes with normal oral functions, it can be surgically removed under local anesthesia. Hope this helps! Thanks.

How can i relieve the stomach ache?

Now, about a month has passed and there is this lump towards the left center side of my stomach, it was sore for a while but isnt all the time, but it usually hurts when i get a cramp. what could it be?
output: Hi, Dear thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns.

output: Dear user about your question I would like to tell you that loss of appetite in infants has some causes, and we should find your possible cause of them....we have two common possibilities of that....first is psychological factor .if the infant has psychological or emotional troubles that will lead to loss of appetite examples of psychological troubles is being punished for eating...if you tried to force him to eat his desire for eating will decrease as there is someone always try to feed him even if he wants and so his sense of appetite decreased because of that......2nd cause is your infant may have iron deficiency anemia and this anemia always causes loss of appetite ...this anemia is common at that age as iron administration not enough in milk, so we always give prophylactic iron therapy to infant at age of 10 month as the anemia will begin.........wish your baby healthy life

input: I have heaviness on the left front side of my head. I get continuous infection on ear nose and mouth(inside cheek getting thickened).This is there for the last 5 years . I tried allopathic ,Ayurveda and homeopathy. The first two are giving relief but not getting a cure. your advice please,
output: Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have constant infection in ear, nose and mouth . Mouth infection can occur due to condition like canker sore. Canker sore is mucosal reaction to various things like hot and spicy food, acidic food, seafood, dental appliances and nuts. There can be other reasons also like deficiency of vitamin B12, folic acid and some underlying disease like crowns. Sometimes infection can spread from ear to upper respiratory track and vice versa and spread to oral cavity also or post nasal Chat Doctor.  I would suggest you to :-- Find out what exactly causes these ulcer like food allergens.- Maintain proper oral hygiene and do mouthwash rinses (Listerine) twice a day.- Rinse your mouth with HY

input: I took a fall on the ice but did not hit my head, I just stretched my back and neck which I felt the next day. But the following day I had dizzieness and loss of ballance. Then it went away for a day and came back worse the next day. I am still experiencing it four days later. what is the problem?
output: Hello! I understand your concern. In my opinion the dizziness and imbalance you have may be related to a cervical spine problem. It may be just degenerative changes of the bones or the disc, pressing on your vertebral artery which supplies the brain. I would recommend you a X-ray of cervical column. Heat procedures and a cervical collar would improve your situation. I would also recommend betahistine twice daily or finalizing for the dizziness. Hope to have been helpful! Thank you for using Chat Doctor! Best wishes

input: Hi, I m 22 and have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis on my face, scalp and torso. I ve exhausted most topical creams and ointments, taken courses of steroids with no real results. Would phototherapy be my next course of action. Is thinking about biologics too radical?
output: Hello. Thank you for writing to topical treatment with ointments and lotions is usually combined with systemic treatment/ oral treatment for psoriasis involving > 20% body surface area. Phototherapy, though is a good choice for extensive body involvement with plaque psoriasis, however, certain body sites like scalp are resistant even to phototherapy. Apart from phototherapy Oral methotrexate is a well known treatment for plaque psoriasis and can be considered in a healthy young adult. Biologics like golimumab, ustekinumab are not first line options in a young patient with limited involvement with plaque psoriasis. Scalp involvement responds well to topical steroids lotions with or without salicylic acid. Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol/ calcitriol lotions are also effective in scalp psoriasis. I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist will assess the severity of involvement and advice accordingly. Regards

Doctors of our place are unable to find diagnosis and she had several medicine relating stomach, colon, antibiotics, anxiety but no use at all. so plz tell me your comment and recommendation if you have any clue regarding this unknown disease.
output: Hello, Actually, it is very difficult to find the cause for Ulcerative Colitis. We have looked hard to find either an infection or something in the diet that might be causing the disease, but have Chat Doctor. For a while it seemed that Ulcerative colitis might be one of those diseases where the body seemed to be attacking itself. We now think that very unlikely, but there is no doubt that something must be causing damage to the lining of the large intestine. As the cause is still not identified, there is no cure for this disease. All treatments available at present are directed towards reducing the amount of inflammation in the bowel. Fortunately, for most patients with Ulcerative colitis, medicines prove effective, although it is possible that your treatment may need to be varied to find the

input: Hi, about a year ago I suddenly woke up during the night with the urge to vomit! Now, i m what you called Emetephobic (fear of throwing up) so obviously, i did everything I could to not throw up and i didn t. But the pain in abdominal area did not seem to go away. Every evening after this particular night at around 8pm (it seemed like someone was just turning on a switch) I would get very hot, sweaty, i would get the shakes, feel dizzy, weak, stomach cramps and sometimes pains and nauseous. I did used to get some sort of relief after having deficating. It would feel like needing to go for a normal size number 2 but literally only a nugget or 2 would pass. This lasted for about 3 months and I was getting to the point where it took away my appetite , I wasn t eating whatsoever, my weight have dropped quite considerably (considering I used to weight lift and stay on a healthy diet), I was about 13/14 stone , it dropped to around 10/11 stone, i m an avid footballer, and i even had to quit playing for my team for a month as I was so ill. Anyway I went to the doctors and they gave me medicine for high levels of acid in my stomach so i took them. Admittedly, they did seem to work but after a while they wore off and I began to feel those symptoms all over again. I went back and they gave me a higher dosage. After a while, everything seemed to just stop and I was fine again, so I started to exercise and eat again...but after 2-3 weeks, well, here we go again! :( ...dizzy, hot, sweaty, nausia, cramps and pains...I eventually got a blood test done which read that my thyroxine levels were a little high, I am due another another one soon to compare. I ve also had an Ultrasound scan done and the nurse who did it, said everything seemed fine, but I ve yet to go to my GP and hear what she has to says about those results. But anyway, right now, I m still getting these symptoms, my stools appear to be alot more normal though, i m back to exercising and eating healthily once again but still with the symptoms pretty much every week, it s just been so long now, i ve kinda got used to it all and just putting up with it! as no-one seems to know what the f*@k is going on! :( this last year has been so horrible! I just want to be me again! everytime I get asked to go out and meet friends in the evenings, i mostly say no as I just know, when it comes that time of the evening, these symptoms will kick in. Does anyone know what is going on?????
output: Hello, Your symptoms with loss of weight and appetite may be more alarming normal ultrasound does not rule out everything. Meet a good gastroenterologist in your area, you may require an Upper GI Endoscopy. Wish you an early recovery.

input: My 12 month old son suffered a skull fracture when he was just a 11 days old. He went to a neuorologist had all his follow up visits. I was told he was fine and I should have nothing to further worry about. Yesterday, I noticed an long indentation on the side where the fracture was. I do not recall feeling this before. He doesn t act like he s in pain or anything but now Im worried something is wrong. Can you help?
output: Hi, since your child has fracture skull at 11 days of life, and you have neurological visits at that time this doesn't seems alarming. It may be an old impression of the fracture. If the child has achieved all the milestones normally and there is no history of recent trauma, it will not be a matter of concern. However, an MRI should be done to see if there is an intracranial abnormality and a visit to neurologist should be done so that we don't miss any findings. I hope this will help you. Take care.

input: friend s 9-yr old daughter got angry with her 6 yr-old brother an repeatedly kicked him in the stomach. He is sore, but has no immediate swelling (now 45-minutes post trauma) and though tender in the abdomen and slightly tender in the ribs, has no difficulty breathing. He has not coughed up any blood, nor is there any in the urine at this time. What signs/symptoms should she be looking for that would require an ER visit? (They are far away and transportation and money are both concerns.)
output: Hello. I just read through your question. Typically, the first hours after being hit are the most painful. With each passing day he should feel improvement and after several days it should be gone. If the pain worsens of the next 1-2 days, that would be a good time to travel to the ER. If not, you don't have to go.

input: L fell on Saturday onto my right upper quid ant and it only started hurting on Tuesday.  Hurts more so when I take a deep breath.  Went to the emergency room on Wednesday.

One was to check for blood lot.  All test were good. I need to go back and let them know about the fall. It is very uncomfortable still.  Scared it is phemonthorax or a blood clot???
output: HI. The pain has developed after 3 days. It is possible that the secretions of pleura are getting absorbed, so you get pain on inspiration. But it is very important to get the CT chest and abdomen as the injuries which manifest after a gap of few days can really be dangerous as we have seen in practice. Go back and Visit for the tests. You may need admission

output: This may be a combination of URI with LETI. You should get a chest X-ray done to rule out any pathology for your chest discomfort. Ear discharge will get resolved once your sinus infection is cleared.

input: My wife has: severe back pain in kidney area (test showed no stones); elevated white blood cell count (test showed no tumors in abdomen); foot and toe cramping; pain has went from 2 to 9 on a scale level in 4 weeks.  (no injury has taken place); Blood in urine (diagnosed).
output: Hi, Looking to the history it seems that there might be having acute urinary tract infection giving rise high W B Count backache and generalized body ache. Having blood in urine possibility of having stone in kidney is likely. Go for Ultra sound kidneys if you required. Go for one antibiotic medicine course for 5 days.Meanwhile, take ibuprofen type medicine for pain and backache. Take plenty of water. Ok and take care.

input: My father has multiple stones in his gall bladdr with severe pain.after ultrasound we came to know.there is also swelling on the wall of it.i want to know is it dangerous? Can the gal bladdr burst? Doctor said we will do surgery after 4 to 5 weeks when swelling will end
output: HelloYour father is rightly advised for surgery after 4-5 weeks. Findings suggests acute calculus cholecystitis means acute infection of gall bladder due to calculus. Definitive treatment in this condition is surgical removal of gall bladder, but it is wise to operate after control of infection. There can be more complications if it is operated at this stage. Surgery can be done microscopically. Recovery is fast by this procedure. Present condition can be managed by antibiotics and analgesics.Don't worry about this. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor. 

input: This started about 2 or 3 days ago but out of nowhere the top part of my butt crack is hurting now if only I sit on that part or if I touch a bit hard(meaning Im touching the part and a bit pushing). I checked in the mirror and it seemed that it was a bit red at that area. I am an 18 year old male and I usually sit on my chair in my room to use the laptop. Is this the cause of me sitting too much in weird positions? Like I dont sit up straight, I like sitting sluggishly, taht is the part where it hurts usually is the part touching the chair base which if you sit straight it doesnt, and I like putting my feet up on the desk because I feel more comfortable and I cant sit still for 10 minutes. What might be the cause of my pain which is not too bad right now but it feels like it is getting worse. I can handle pain but I am concerned about my health.
output: Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to sciatica pain. I suggest using anti-inflammatory medications such as Acetaminophen to relieve the symptoms. I also suggest using cold compresses to relieve the pain. Furthermore, I recommend stretching exercises for relieve.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hi, Thanks for your query. From description, it seems to be soft tissue injury. Swelling might be due to hematoma formation(collection of blood). You need an x-ray to rule out any bony injury. I suggest you to consult an orthopaedician nearby for a detailed examination. You may get the X-ray of the area affected under his/her guidance. Beside icing and elevating it, you can take anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more concern. Warm Regards.

You should get follicular study also so that you come to know about your ovulation time n fruitful period.

input: I also have been experiencing a lower left abdominal vibration, no pain. Started on July 18th. I had been painting and scraping the garage, on a ladder. thought maybe this triggered something. It went on, off and on for 2 weeks. We went to visit our son and NYC. Put on 45 miles walking. no problem. Came home. Off and on vibration started again, then stopped completely for ;7 days. Now back again. I am 64, weight about 148, take advair for asthma. The vibration is annoying and scary because I don t know what is causing it and hoped after it had stopped for 7 days that it would go away on its own.
output: Hi. Regards. Thanks for an elucidated history, which say you have walked 45 miles too. This indicates that there is no intra-abdominal problem. The vibration in the left lower abdomen looks to be due to the tics of the musculature of that part of the abdominal wall possibly due to a pinched nerve, or an automatic discharge of the nerve or may be a disc in the thoracic region. Get examined by an Orthopedic Surgeon / General Surgeon to get a physical examination done, an ultrasonography of the abdomen and an MRI of the thoracolumbar spine. Relax, this is not a serious problem, although it is definitely an irritating one.

input: I have had blood in my urine for 5 days now. Day one, I went to the ER in a lot of pain and found out I have several stones in my kidneys, including one that hasnt passed that is 3mm in size. I am in intermittent pain still, that is mostly in my lower back and wraps down the right side of my lower abdomen. I feel a lot of bloating and pressure. I went to the Urgent Care yesterday and they read the CT scan from day one, I havent had an ultrasound, should I get one?

input: My friend has problem of excessive protein around his heart and kidneys which cause him great difficulty in breathing. I forgot the name of the problem, something like acelodosis.  What does he need to do because the doctors he is visiting dont seem to be helping at all.

She is having a little burning sensation while passing urine (frequently in smaller amounts discharge). She is 45 years old and diabetic patient. She is also having a mild burn sensation from right side of the chest.We have given her Tramadol Hydrochloride Injection, Rantac 150mg, Rabesec D SR and Dolo 650 from evening. She started vomiting after giving the injection and Rabesec D SR. She is still having pain after giving the above medication.Please suggest us what we should do now.
output: Hi...she is having ureteric stone with urinary tract infection and gastritis...get an ultrasound scan done...also tramadol injection if given undiluted or pushed rapidly, causes vomiting.

input: i have started having mild memory problems, constant headaches, ranging from mild to severe, and have started stuttering when i ve never stuttered before in my life. I m worried because Alzheimers runs in my family, although i am a nineteen year old woman with bipolar disorder and ptsd. what s going on? should i be worried?
output: Hello You are a 19 years old female with family history of Alzheimer's disease. You have complaints of memory problems and this is causing severe stress in you. You are a known case of bipolar disorder and PTSD. Most likely the memory problems are not related to Alzheimer's disease. You already have BPD, so such symptoms may occur due to depression and anxiety. Such symptoms are also called pseudo dementia. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for expert opinion. Hope this helps you, thanks

output: Hi, I think you should go for evaluation first.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries. Also, a semen analysis of your husband should be done. If everything is fine, you can take these medicines.  Track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for 2 weeks after the rupture. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months. Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

output: Hello thanks for asking from Chat Doctor for your health related queries can understand your concern. Persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms that impair day to day functioning should never be ignored. Self-medication, relaxation exercises can help but if the anxiety is causing problems in functioning and relationship then there is need to see a psychiatrist. For anxiety medicines like SSRIs as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Escitalopram etc. are used commonly. These medicines will help to decrease persistent anxiety and will improve the depressed mood. Apart from this for relief of symptoms of anxiety benzodiazepines or other Chat Doctor.  These medicines can help to reduce symptoms in acute anxiety situations. Continue to do relaxation exercises and mediation and this will supplement the actions of medicines. Please visit a psychiatrist for evaluation and help. Thanks, Take care

input: dear doc, me & my(28years) wife had sex on December 24, 25, 26(protected).she had her period on January 16-22, a heavy one like regular(no sex in between as we work in different countries) . now in February, she is 13 days late. should we worry about her being pregnant or other health issues? we re not trying for a baby so early in our career.thanks in advance.
output: Hello, Thanks for letting us know your health concern. If you did not have any further intercourse after your wife had her natural period, there is no need to worry about pregnancy. This delay in menstrual cycle could be due to a transient hormone imbalance often caused by sudden weight changes, stress, infections etc. Please ask her to see her health care provider to detect the cause and plan further management. If the sonogram of the pelvis shows normal study, hormones can be given to induce the period. Hope this helps.

input: yes my son n law was puching my daughter in stomach to abort baby my daughter had been haing severe pain for 2 weeks through her body took her to 2 hospitals they refused to treat her due to her being pregnant so he calls said she need to go to doctor i got her to a hospital they took her in was not for sure what was going on and after she passed they said endocarditis which after she was buried when we find he been punching her.the baby did not have fluid around it,my daughter had infection over her entire body was coughing up blood chest pains rapid heart rate of 228do u think him punching her could cause the endocarditis?
output: Hi and pleased to answer you. Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis. Sorry for your daughter and may god has his soul in peace.

input: I have a sore on my stomach that started out as a small red bump and in the past 2 weeks has turned purple, peeled back, and started bleeding and oozing pus. I am worried only because it has been here so long and because it is very tender to touch. It now is a small hole that is open and it seems to be getting a little larger but is still very small. What could this be and what are good treatments for it?
output: It looks like a fistulous or sinus tract in your abdominal wall. So it is basically treated by sinus tractarsupialisation with normal granulation tissue. Go for a surgeon and sonography with tract exploration.

input: my mother has been in the hospital for 16 days, they first said she has breast cancer, then they said Lymphoma, then they said Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, now saying she has Leukemia - they keep saying they are 95% sure but then come back and say they were wrong, do you have any suggestions for me as to what to do from here?  We are in Richmond, Virginialisa
output: Dear, First we need to have full history and examination of the body report. Then a blood picture with peripheral smear examination to arrive at some provisional diagnosis. If she has a lump or swelling on any part of the body a fine needle aspiration biopsy report. This will definitely give a diagnosis. I think your primary physician will definitely do what is necessary to arrive at final conclusion. The different diagnosis conveyed to you must be provisional on the basis of simple general physical examination. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's or non Hodgkin or leukemia is confirmed only by biopsy. Truly,

output: Dear madam, you need to go to ER if you feel constant pain, fever, breathless, vomit blood or feel fatigue but your symptoms definitely means something and detailed work up should be done. You obviously have some kind of intestinal passage disorder caused by either mechanical or non-mechanical causes. YOUR GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY U VE DESCRIBED COULD affect your intestinal motility and if there is a certain cause then pills won't be helpful. The best way to rule this out is to the colonoscopy, barium swallow or diagnostic laparoscopy and everything should be clear. Wish you good health,

input: Hi, My son is 18 months old. He is suffering from fever and motions. I met a doctor yesterday. She prescribed bifilac sachet and suggested to give only 1/2 sachet three times a day. But my wife gave 1 sachet three times a day by mistake(total 3 sachets we gave today). Now we have a fear about the over dosage. Can you please suggest me what will happen if there is a overdose and what are the precautionary steps we can take now if it is a serious thing?
output: One sachet thrice daily is not an overdose/ toxic dose in 18 months old toddler. In a toddler more dose may lead to giddiness due to hypoglycemia. Excess of Lactobacillus may utilize the lactose in food to grow.

input: Hi . Im concerned about whats going on . I think Im pregnant , but Im nervous to find out because I dont want to be devastated that Im not . My last normal period was Jan 21 . I always have normal periods . ALWAYS. I have a calendar that I go by . It said that my next expected period was Feb 18 . On Feb 17th I started spotting . I only seen it when I wipe . I never had this happen to me before . When my period comes on it flows and its never light . This went on for the remainder of the day then the next day it got darker , but it filled up half of pantie liner . After that I used tampons to see if he will be regular and it wasnt . It was just little spots of blood . Im nervous to take a test . Could I be pregnant ?
output: Hello, In the current scenario, please do get the pregnancy test done as you definitely need it and hope for the best. If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified. If pregnancy is excluded, you could be having slight hormonal imbalance which is common now and then whenever there is some stress, infection, weight disturbance etc. Such a disturbance usually gets corrected spontaneously. Hope this helps.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.

output: Hi, I understand your concern.  - First, 6you have to get her fully investigated from a chest physician & know about the extent of her infection. If its active tuberculosis passing the infection to others via coughing, sneezing)& she needs isolation or her disease is non infecting & under control. She can be treated at home & she can feed her baby at this stage.  Speak to her doctor & decide - Medicines, regular consumption & regular follow up is a must. Tuberculosis can be fully controlled & patient can lead a normal life if she follows treatment plan exactly.  - Apart from this personal care in form of- - cleanliness, - high protein, vitamin, iron, mineral diet.  She needs high proteins in form of milk 2 glasses in a day, boiled egg/ protein powder available in pharmacy mixed with milk./ fresh vegetables & salads at least 10 glasses of clean water . Apart from her routine meals.  - light exercises (yoga/ walking/ respiratory exercises) . To help good appetite & digestion -Iron & vitamins in form of tonics as per doctors advise.  Thanks.

SHE IS CRYING VERY MUCH. SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as, or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents, we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more liquors per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause Chat Doctor. Regards - 

input: I am 36 yrs and pregnant with 12weeks I have a daughter 11 yrs I have a history of pcod and endometriosis I had a miscarriage in my first pregnancy and it was triplets. both my pregnancy was with treatment but this time with the grace of God I conceived naturally I am being given fertygen injection twice a week progestrone capsule and now asa tablets but yesterday I was bleeding with big clots after scan the baby was fine internal os closed placenta posterior mid segment dont know the reason for bleeding can you please tell me why is this happening and why is asa tablets prescribed in pregnancy I would be very grateful thank you
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries.

input: im 18 and I have 2 questions. my first question is i suffer from endometriosis and for the past week my left and right ovary area has been having burning/stinging pains and my lower pelvic region is sore to the touch. what could this problem be? my second question is i had my hormone levels checked and i was wondering if they are normal? FSH- 1.2 LH-3.1 TSH-1.570 Estradiol-182 Testosterone-32 Glucose-74 Prolactin-19.8 thanks, sabrina
output: Greetings HOPE you are aware of endometriosis. It means the inside layer of uterus called as endometrium is present outside the uterus, and it responds to the cyclical changes as inside uterus causing bleeding. As you have menses, there will be bleeding from this endometrium which can be present anywhere in the abdomen.the commonest site is ovary and all around outer side of uterus. So premenstrual there will be pain which depends up on the organ involved and the extent. So you can consult a gynecologist and get an ultrasound scan to rule out any cysts in ovary which is causing problems for you. Coming to your reports everything looks normal if done on day 2 or 3 of your cycle. Hope my answer helps you regards

input: My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance.
output: HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck.

output: Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query from you to my Chat Doctor Clinic.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Hello.  My father has been suffering from high blood pressure and two weeks ago his pulse was at 125 for a number of days.  This landed him in the hospital for about 10 days. He was diagnosed with atrial fibralation as well as anxiety and chronic fatigue.  Both he and the rest of my family have been taking care of my mother who is has a terminally ill with cancer.  He is on a number of medications now and is taking Lisinipril and cumodin and other meds.  His cumodin level was high this week.  He walked to the store the other day and had to ask for a ride back as he wasnt feeling well.  The hospice nurse took his blood pressure and pulse today: 153/100, pulse 50.  She said that he should get checked out again soon as something does not appear right with his meds.  Any advice you might be able to give would be appreciated.  My father is 79 years old.  Thank you.  Melinda
output: Hello, There are two issues in him, first his blood pressure is not under control so his BP medicine needs to be hiked up. Dose of lisinopril can be increased in multiple of 5 up to 40 mg. Blood pressure is not emergency you can get it optimized from your doctor.  Secondly, his pulse rate is low and pulse rate controlling med needs to be decreased. Like he must take some beta blockers like metoprolol or nebivolol, or other medicines like Verapamil or Diltiazem, dose of either med needs to be decreased.  Also, he should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Get your lipid profile and sugars tested once. Monitor INR regularly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hello, I have a persisting infection in my pubic groin area. For the past year it comes and goes regularily and almost always is infected. I believed it to be an ingrown hair but most recently I went to the hospital because a hole appeared there and I was told it is a cyst . This keeps happening in the exact same spot and I apply warm compresses to it and blood like pus usually oozes out of it. It pains a bit as i were my pants exactly same place. Kindly suggest me what to do
output: HI, I understand your concern.  The prolonged & repeated infection indicates healing.  -low resistance - inadequate treatment/wrong choice of antibiotic - unhygienic condition.  - Uncontrolled diabetes You need investigations like-CBC, fasting & post meal blood sugar, culture & sensitivity test of the exudate from infection. Along with complete physical check up.  This would pinpoint the diagnosis & treatment plan.(best advised by a skin specialist) Apart from regular medication for prescribed period, you will have to take - tonics/nutritive diet for raising resistance.(proteins, iron, vitamins specially it. B&c)would help.  - good control of blood sugar in case you have diabetes - adequate local management in form of removal of hairs, keeping the area clean, Chat Doctor.  Thanks. -

input: Hello, i have a question, i had pain for almost a week on the left lower side of abdomen, approximately where the ovary is, then i went to ultrasound to see what is going on, i did not get results yet, and i am scared, because i really wanted to get pregnant, i overheard  ultrasound technician and other technician, they were saying something like follicle burst and small amount of free fluid, what does it mean, that i did not get pregnant and probably instead maybe it is ovarian cyst now..i just dont know what to think... i asked them but they are not allowed to tell diagnosis i guess, they just said you dont have to worry everything is fine
output: Hellos you mentioned that there is pain in the abdomen in the left lower region. Ultrasound done but report is still pending. Pain may be due to these reasons.1 Cyst around or in ovarian stoma. Need not say that the report of the ultrasound will find out the reason .2 Such pain may be due to left renal colic. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Ultrasound (. Already done).3 Amoebic colitis is the next most probable reason of such pain. Stool examination will find out amoeba history, if present. Since ultrasound report is pending and pain is not so severe, wait for the report and deal according to ultrasound report. Possibilities I have mentioned. Good luck

input: Hi, I am a 63 yr old female. I tripped and fell a week ago, slamming my knee on the concert. It turned black and blue just below my knee and is still numb to the touch. I have been icing it and staying off of it as much as possible. Yesterday, I noticed that my ankle is now swollen and black and blue. There appears to be a yellowish streak down my shin also. I also felt the sensation of blood running down my leg, but there was none. There is no open wound. I can walk on it without to much trouble. I am just not sure how to proceed from this point. Do I need to go to the doctor, or is what I am doing okay. I know it will take probably 6 to 8 weeks to heal. I did not go to the doctor when this happen, so I am not sure if I fractured my leg or not. But, if I did, what could/would they do?

input: I recently had a scan that showed a 8.4mm cyst on my left kidney. However as I was being scanned for gallstones, the cyst was never mentioned (the scan was done overseas and so they type up a report of their findings). I am now worried that it has been disregarded. What could it be?
output: Hello Thanks for writing to simple cortical cyst in kidney is a benign lesion of unknown etiology arising from renal parenchymal, and it rarely causes complications. It may be the reason for omission of small renal cyst in previous reports. Renal cortical cyst is a very common type of kidney cyst, and it is a fluid-filled sac. Small cysts generally doesn't causes symptoms, and it is found in a routine examination for other issues. When cyst grows larger, patient may feel pain or pressure in back or sides, which often radiates downward. Renal cortical cysts usually doesn't require any treatment. Take Care Chat Doctor. 

input: my wife had a prolapsed disc aprox 8 years ago, she is now left with arthirtes and very bad pain, nerve damage, loss of felling in lower right leg. We was told that after 18 months after an op what ever pain she in still in that is as good as it is going to be, we think that when she had the op after cutting the bone above and below and cutting out the piece of disc they fused the two bones together? My wife is now unable to walk without having to use a stick or if it is to far then she is in a wheelchair, is there anything that can be done for her to help with her movement without more surgery?
output: Hello! Thank you for the query. In some cases such symptoms can be eased with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  But this can be done with herniation which does not compress the spine or compresses only a little. You can ask your doctor about Diclofenac and Tetra Pak treatment, however surgery might be the only solutions. Hope this will help. Regards.

input: at night when I get ready for bed I begin to cough uncontrolledly and my neck and chin get really itchy. this only happens at night and I don t know what to do about it or what it means. I read that it could be signs of asthma but I ve never been diagnosed with it. But I do spend a total of 9 hours or more 5 days a week moving and running around.
output: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having allergic bronchitis. Coughing and itching are characteristics for allergic disease (process). Since you are having symptoms mostly at night, you may be allergic to your night clothes or bedsheet or pillow covers etc. And these act as allergen and cause symptoms. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to diagnose bronchitis. Change your bedsheet, pillow cover and night clothes. Start using new cotton ones. Also take antihistamine Chat Doctor.  You will mostly be alright by these changes.

input: Im asking because I was tested for diabetes & the doctor asked if it ran in my family? It does on both my mother & fathers side & I have always had a sweet tooth but I am not overweight (Im average) & try not to eat fatty foods that much. I do however tend to splurge on the sugar. Can too much sugar cause diabetes? Thanks everyone.
output: Hi.no too much sugar doesn't lead to diabetes. There r 2 types of diabetes. Type 1 which is due to deficiency of insulin secretion from beta cells of pancreas and in type 2 diabetes there is problem in the insulin receptors. Diabetes may result from genetic alterations, obesity, sedentary lifestyle. Ones u have diabetes, increase intake of sugar may increase the blood sugar level but sugar itself doesn't lead to diabetes. Wish u good health

input: I take microgynon 30 3 weeks at a time and then break for a week and always get a period during this break. I took the pill for around 5 weeks without a break and now that Ive taken a break from it Ive not experienced a withdrawal bleed and Im getting very worried. Could you offer me an explanation? Ive taken one test and it was negative. Just want to know whats going on with my body, Ive been taking the pill almost 3 years with no problems like this.
output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Microgynon is a commonly used oral contraceptive. There is a form of oral contraception where essentially it is taken for 3 months so that these women have only 4 periods a year. It is likely that the prolonged use of the medication resulted in the delay you are experiencing. Though it is understandably alarming to you, it is a result of a slight hormonal imbalance and your period will return. I hope this helps

input: sir i got a preterm baby of 34 weeks.on his first thyroid test he has following values T3 IS 74.48, T4 IS 3.40 TSH IS 2.69. ON HIS SECOND TEST AFTER 1MONTH WE HV FOLLOWING VALUES T3 99.51, T4 IS 3.60, TSH IS 3.21. BT IS THIS LEVEL OF T4 OKEY OR SHOULD WE GO TO A DOCTOR

input: Since October 2013 I have had spasmodically pain in the right side of my head in the ear area - approx radiating into an area of my hand if held over my ear. The pain will go after anything from a few hours to over 36 hours. Today it is particularly painful hence the search online
output: You probably mean throbbing headache affecting one side of the head, right in your case. You have not mentioned whether you are a male or female. Based on that, I would consider three possible causes, a) migraine b) cluster headache and c) temporal arthritis. Irrespective of whatever be the cause, you should be relieved by taking naproxen 500 mg one or two tablets together as per your requirement. Take it in full stomach. Also get yourself examined by a doctor and subsequently intervene as per the cause diagnosed.

input: Im 62 years of a age, and on a routine lab exam PSA level was 6.5, Digital rectal exam was normal, echography shows enlarged prostate with calcifications and all the rest was normal.. FREE PSA/TOTAL PSA was about 22.5 and according to the lab this result is normal, urine analysis shows RBC levels of 20 - 22 and WBC 2, can we know from these results if it s a gland hypertrophy or it s prostate cancer? thank you
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer. As calcification is 100% benign. It is not at all seen in malignancy.  So you should not worry much about cancer.  Your other lab reports are also normal for cancer. You are having BPH (benign prostatic enlargement) which is causing red blood cells in urine. So better to consult neurosurgeon and get done removal of prostate.  This will cure RBC in urine. And no need to worry about cancer.

input: Hi there, Im a 25 year old male with a history of Kidney Stones. I ve had a 3cm Kidney Stone in my left Kidney for some time now and have been attempting to dilute it.

input: hello,my 2 and a half year old has been having tiny amount of blood at the end of the stool...my pediatrician ordered an ex ray and said she was constipated evan though she poops quite regularly.He said most likely the blood comes from a scratch at the end of the bowel that continually gets irrataded and then today the stool turned gray! half of it came out brown then gray and two hours later more grey poop what could this mean?
output: Dear Parent, The gray color stool of your child can be due to different causes. Commonest one if your child is on a milk only diet. Other serious cause is blocked liver ducts (however in this condition your child will give yellow of eyes, skin). I suggest that you see a pediatrician if the gray stools occur 2 or more times, lasts more than 24 hrs and lasts more than 48 hours after changing from a milk only diet, and you notice yellow discoloration of eyes, skin.

input: Hello please I would like for you to tell me I had ovarian cancer after my operation i had liposuction after this my Cancer came back then I went through chemotherapy my result after that was normal now I had more stomach pains went to see the doctor my blood test ca 125 was raised I had a ct scan which shows that my other organs are fine but is showing more thickness of my stomach lining ! After my liposuction there has always been thickness of the lining I want to know does this lipo have anything to do with cancer as my doctor at the hospital wasn t 100 percent sure of this thickening of the lining is due to cancer or not.
output: Hi, its really not got much to do with the cancer. The ideal thing would be to redo another CT scan, to better evaluate the integrity of the stomach. The stomach is however not one of the usual destinations of spread of ovarian cancer. It shall be very unlikely that the thickening should attack the stomach first with other structures intact. Another CT scan can help clear the doubt. Thanks

input: Hi my name is angela im 20 years old and on June 9, 2015 I went to an oral surgeon to have all four of my wisdom teeth taken out. Ever sense the day after surgery I haven t been able to open my mouth I have gone back and they put me on some arthritis Tylenol, naproxen medication, and also voltarin gel. I ve also been doing jaw excersises religiously. Nothing has helped and I am no worse I can t fit my toothbrush in mouth and it s almost to the point I can t fit my pills in either. I m terrified and just want this to end.
output: Hi. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint at times after wisdom teeth extraction the muscles of mastication becomes tensed, swollen and sore leading to restricted mouth opening and pain. You should do warm compresses over the check and continue till the sides of neck. You should massage the muscles with your fingers starting from the front of ear progressing down the jaw reaching the chin. Try to open the mouth with fingers by pushing front teeth apart. You should also keep doing the jaw exercises advised by your dentist. You need to take Muscle relaxant like Flexion MR for relieving the spasms of muscles. Take soft diet and more. Of liquids but do not stay hungry. If still it doesn't improve consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  Please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.  She should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. I hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately. Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy. Sincerely,

input: I had wisdom teeth extraction four days ago. Was running a temp today, which has now come down, and feeling unwell. Aches, headache and very tired . These symptoms appeared about two days after my surgery . I has Iv sedation . Im worried about septicemia or endocarditis? AmI over reacting . I saw my dentistToday to address my symptoms and he didnt seem worried . Stated my extraction sites were not infected . ShouldI see a MD?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing, All you need to do is relax. These symptoms are sometimes seen after a normal minor surgery. As you told, you were given general anesthesia, please give some time for yourself to recover.  Fever can also normally occur after a stressful procedure, and just as it came down, you will recover with other problems also with time.  Just continue with the antibiotics or analgesics whatever are prescribed by your dentist.  Septicemia or endocarditis are risk factors if you have undergone any previous surgeries or have any congenital heart problems or valve replacements. In that case the doctor prescribes you with antibiotics before the procedure itself.  Take sufficient rest and relax to have a fast recovery. You only need to see a physicist if symptoms persist even after taking adequate rest.  Stay healthy, Thank you.

In case if tooth can be saved root canal treatment can be done while if there is gross decay extraction followed by antibiotics and painkillers will be advisable. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

output: Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor.  I am sad to hear about your brother health. Neuronal injuries are often permanent, so complete recovery is rare in such cases. Over a period of time some improvement in memory and behavior is possible.  After brain injuries some personality changes are possible which can lead to aggressive behavior. In such cases low dose anti-psychotic medicines are helpful. For that you can consult some nearby psychiatrist. Wish you all the best.  Chat Doctor. 99doctor.com

Sometimes it still feels like i have a massive tooth pain there and also my teeth on the other side of my mouth are starting to hurt a little as well(Also the tooth they extracted was abscessed). Is this all normal? I m 21 and haven t had a tooth removed since I was 5 and it s kind of freaking me out that my mouth hurts this bad still since its been 5 days. Also I was curious on why I m 21(22 in may) and haven t gotten my wisdom teeth in yet.
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, As you have mentioned the first molar you got extracted was involved with abscess. So after extraction the socket needs to be curetted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants, disinfection of the socket is done, and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze .any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Chat Doctor.  You need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth, they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years, so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdom tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any, will help in deciding treatment. I hope I answered all your doubts, take care.

input: For the past 2 or 3 months, I have had very strong, pulsing heart beats and trembly feeling inside my chest that will not go away. Also, I have severe hypertensive periods, vertigo, and tinnitus. I have a history of Hashimoto s but TSH is normal, now. I have had brain MRI, Ct scans, EKGs, carotid dopppler, blood chemistries and all appear to be within normal range, with the exception of Vit D, I have added 5,000IU/day. However, about 2 weeks ago, I had an episode of hypocalcemia, confirmed by Trousseau s sign, periorbital parysthesia, etc.. (but total serum calcium was normal). I have since added calcium supplements. I am currently on 60 mg Cardizem 3x/day but BP is still 150/90. (I had an allergic reaction to carvedilol - hives, swelling.) Have been to ER 3x recently with hypertensive episodes 200/115 and palpitations. Have been to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and PCP. Should I go to a neurologist? What other things can cause these conditions?
output: Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that these symptoms do not seem to be related to any neurological conditions, especially considering the high blood pressure values.  Coming to this point, I would recommend checking cortisol plasma levels, aldosterone plasma levels and urinary metanephrines in order to exclude a possible a Chat Doctor.  A panic disorder cannot be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend trying low dose Alprazolam during these episodes and see if your situation improves.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: i have a little bit of blood in my urine, what could it be? i wiped some on toilet paper and it was a faint orange color, so it was not much, i 1st noticed it this morning when it hurt to pee, the pain was a decent amount, i got back from school and went to the bathroom again and it hurt again but a lot less than this morning. there is no one with diabetes in my family, so it might be UTI (even though i have never had sex).
output: First get your urine examination done to confirm whether it is urine in blood or something else. Most common cause for blood in urine is calculus. Common cause varies from male to female. UTI can cause blood in urine, but not the commonest cause. So to know the cause complete urine & sonography is required. Treatment depends on the cause. Start taking plenty of liquids it will definitely help you.  Disclaimer

output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bedsores are the first sign of infection in a person who is immobile. Please inform her doctors and make arrangement for her to sleep on water bed to avoid more bed sores from happening. Since she is diabetic, there is possibility of the bedsore developing an aggressive infection. First medications are to be applied in the region of bedsore. A nursing attendant must be put in charge of turning her posture regularly and keeping the surface between the skin and bed Chat Doctor.  This will prevent sweat from accumulating and preventing new sore formation. Attempts are also to be made to lower her blood glucose. Diabetes causes infections to spread quickly to other areas and this must be prevented. Please check the bedsore wound every 6 hours and change surgical 

input: yes hi there i have a back tooth that has been sheared off to the gum line and has an exposed nerve a friend of mine gave me a couple of CLINDAMYCIN HCL 150mg. capsules  i was wondering if you think these will help my tooth till i can get to a dentist on Monday since the ER said there really isnt anything they can do and i should see a dentist thank you for your time and help in this matter Rich.
output: Hello there, Thanks for writing your query, Your clinical history suggests you are suffering from a severe periodontitis.  It is a condition where gum line with respect to the tooth shows severe recession and exposure of the root surfaces of the teeth.  It is caused due poor oral hygiene, improper brushing and flossing that leads to accumulation of bacterial plaque and calculus deep in the gum pockets and root surfaces of the teeth.  Yes CLINDAMYCIN is an antibiotic which can be used to prevent infection and suppress further damage, but antibiotic will work better when you get the gum treated by dental procedures. It needs to be treated by thorough professional deep scaling of gums and root planing of the teeth to remove all the irritants, this will help in resolving the symptoms followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesics.  I hope this helps, take care.

output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for the query. Naproxen and warfarin are not similar Chat Doctor.  I suggest not to change warfarin dosage. This is more important than pain treatment. He should take some opioid painkillers if naproxen and colchicine aren't helpful but i don't think he should stop warfarin.  Wish you good health.

input: I have been diagnosed with Syncope and want to know exactly what it is. I also suffer from kidney disease and was on dialysis for 2 1/4 years. Now my creatine level is at 1.9. What is a normal level? I lost both legs and the majority of fingers on my dominate left hand due to Thrombotic Thrombocytopinia Purpura. (T.T.P. in 2003
output: Hello! Thank you for the question! I understand your clinical situation. A syncope is a sudden loss of body tone, with loss of conscience which lasts for some seconds. As a result the person falls sown immediately without understanding what happened. This is caused by a disorder called autonomic dysfunction which causes episodes of low blood perfusion to the brain. Have you had Chat Doctor? Renal failure is a common complication of these disorders. Syncope too. Renal failure can also cause syncope. So you have two RISC factors for syncope. The normal levels for creatinine are 0.5-1.5 mg/dl for men and 0.6-1.2 mg/ml for women. Your level is not too high. Hope to have helpful. Thank you for using Chat Doctor! Best wishes

input: Hello, I noticed a large dark purple bruise on my boyfriend s lower right abdomen. He has not been hit or otherwise injured, and there is only slight pain to the touch. His gallbladder was removed two months ago, if that is any help. I am worried because the bruise came out of nowhere and seems to be getting bigger.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Read the history about your boyfriend and understood it. There is a history of gall bladder removal 2 months back. And now a bruise on the same - right side of the abdominal wall for no apparent reason. The possible cause can be reactivation of an infection in the abdominal wall post-surgery. Get an ultrasonography of the abdominal wall, X-ray to see if there is any Gas shadow. This indicates infection. Consult a General Surgeon and start on the treatment of antibiotics. If this does not settle with medicines, may need a Chat Doctor.

This would regress in next 2-3 was time.-Hope this reliefs your worry-some query. Welcome for any more queries in time to come. Have a Good Day.

input: i recently started playing girls water polo at school and yesterday whale i was showering and cleaning my body i found a bump on my butt and when i touched it, it hurt. and today at school when i would sit it would hurt i have no idea what this is or what it can be i have never had anything like this before
output: Hello! Thank you for the query. If this lump is in the butt cheek area, infected colonial cyst is the most probable reason. If the lump is somewhere else on the butt, skin infection and small abscess it is. In both cases you need to have it incised and Chat Doctor.  Otherwise, it will get more painful. In case of colonial cyst you need to have it removed when the acute inflammation will be gone. Please consult general surgeon with this issue. Hope this will help. Regards.

input: I have enlarged foliate papilla on the right side of my tongue.  I have them for quite some time now.  My dentist did a "brush over" cancer test and it came back negative.  However, they do not seem to be going away.  They are also associated with a burning feeling in that area.  Any comments or suggestions?
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor . I understand you concern there is nothing to be worried, this is enlarged papillae is seen this can be due to deficiency of vitamin supplements, iron deficiency, or due to acidity also. For this you can take some medication by consulting you doctor one tablet multivitamin once daily for 15 days.

input: My 5month old fell off the bed, cried for a short while and calmed down. I observed him the next 2 days and he now has a bruise on his head I m almost certain from the fall. He is already teething so he has an occasional temp brought down by Tylenol. Should I take him in to be seen?
output: Hello. I just read through your question. A bruise on the head is expected after a fall. As long as there was no loss of consciousness at the time of the injury, there is no need for concern. The bruise will take several days, up to a couple of weeks, to subside. If he is otherwise well, there is no need to take him to the doctor.

output: Hello. Thanks for your query. If your period has started after GUI, then there is no chance that your GUI is successful.

I will be available if you have any further queries. Regards

input: I was prescribed the following drug clindamycin 150mg capsules due to an oral medical issue. I have oral implants with a bridge. The screws broke off in my jaw. The attached bridge has come totally undone, leaving the open gum. The prescription has been prescribed as a preventive measure. I have no pain and no sign of invection as yet . After reading the warnings that came attached with the prescription filled at Walgreens I am extremely hesitant to take the drug due to the severe side effects. Possible death due toStevens Johnson syndrome ... I live alone so I not going to take the drug and take my chances with invection. Is that a wise choice?
output: Hi. Thanks for the query. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Well taking Clindamycin does not always cause side effects and that too are not always life-threatening, so better first relax. If you go through the side effects of any antibiotics you will always find a long list but all the side effects are not always seen in each individual who take the Chat Doctor. . So my suggestion is to continue taking Clindamycin. If you still doubt you can go for Allergic testing and once confirmed you can take safer antibiotics without fear of fatal side effects. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: I have an issue with my right knee I have a slight raised place on the lower outside part of the knew and have had for about 2 weeks it doesn t hurt down deep like a joint or tendon but rather the skin hurts to the touch or when i have pants on I certainly have never had anything like it before Any Thoughts??
output: Hello, As I understand with the query is all about the burning sensation. Now, this is not related to the knee. As you never mentioned the injury, so I suspect that you haven't had any. This burning sensation is related to the nerve root. Due to weakness in the spinal region, the nerve root gets impingement. As the nerve has the function of carrying the sensory and motor, any impingement of the nerve will cause the dysfunction in the normal functions of the nerve. I think if you do core strengthening exercises then your symptoms will subside Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

input: I was tested for c diff and it came back positive. I am now on my 2nd round of flagyl, and I have a low grade temp of 99.9. I noticed that both times Ive taken this medication, my stool looks suspicious. I notice small 1/2 inch white looking worms on the toilet paper.  At first I thought it was just the t.p. balling up when I wiped but then I noticed a couple on my stool in the water.  Is this just from the meds or is there a parasite concern.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor, Hopefully the worms are coming out. Send a sample for testing if you find next time. If it is confirmed that that is worm only you may need benzimidazole Chat Doctor. Hope this explains with regards

input: hi there , im 6 weeks pregnant and since yesterday morning i started having pinkish discharge on wiping with no pain i did na ChatDoctor level it was 1280 . today it was repeated and became 1450. they couldnt find a sac on transvaginal u/s intra or extrauterine . the bleeding has become less today . i had cramps in the morning through the afternoon but they r resolving . after taking IVFC injection
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  In such a case it is difficult to determine the cause, It may be an inevitable abortion in the very early days of pregnancy, and presented at this date, H.C.G. may be positive for some more days, and the cramps could be due to the small mass of the sac, to be expelled, or may be due to infection. Ultrasound will be the final finding to rely upon. Still your doctor will be the better judge.  Wishing for a better health. Thank you.

input: Last Sunday i passed out. when my friend checked on me, i was unresponsive. when at the hospital my blood pressure was 76/48. after regaining conciousness, i couldnt speak correctly or move my right leg and arm. within a day, i was back to normal and prescribed nothing and given no answers. what happened to me?
output: Hello, There could be a few reasons to your symptoms. Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission

input: iam 41 yrs old recently the dark pig mentation around eyes and mouth are very prominent. i consulted kaya skin clinic they suggested skin lightening alternated with mesoglow treatment once amonth for 4months. but they gave partial success in the whole process.iw ould like to go for second opinion. is there any other alternative procedure for my problem.
output: Hi, Visible pigmentation in human results from the synthesis and distribution of melanin in the skin, hair bulbs and eyes.Hyperpigmentation can result from excessive sun exposure, use sunscreen with SPF 30. Some natural remedies are-mixture of lemon juice and cream; apply on face. Put lemon juice onto basil leaves. This is great for getting rid of pigmentation marks and dark circles that may have been a long-time problem. Apply lime (NIMBY) to the affected area, and after 15 minutes wash it off. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Comic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However, mellow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality. Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells, making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than comic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care. Best regards,

input: my 26 year old son is for past 3 weeks is complaining about tighness tingling and numbness under his left rib cage. No pain. He says it comes and goes and he doesn t feel it at all when he is lying down. He is very atletic and plays major basketball and baseball. Is this a common problem
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases for his symptoms because left sided chest discomfort is common in heart diseases. So get done ECG and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes in young age, stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in his life and start working on its solution. He may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, he will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

input: My 7 yr old son is adopted from Guatemala. We have recently noticed a faint white line in the middle of his chest from just below his nipples almost all the way to his belly button. Is this normal? Anything to worry about? Any indicator of any kind of health problem?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. This white line can be normal finding, but better to get done following tests. 1. CBC (complete blood count). 2. Vitamin b 12 level 3. Calcium and vitamin d3 level. 4. Thyroid function test. Anemia, vitamin b12 deficiency, low calcium and vitamin d3 and hypothyroidism can cause similar skin changes. So get done above-mentioned tests. If all are normal then no need to worry much. This line will gradually go away with time. And if any of the test is low then your child needs supplements.

I no longer am experiencing shortness of breath, but I still have weasing in my bronchial tree. I am not a smoker.

output: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. Age more than 50 is an individual risk factor for bronchitis. You are also having wheezing with shortness of breath, these also favors possibility of bronchitis more. Bilateral septal thickening is also seen in bronchitis due to inflammation. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but also tell you about severity of the disease. And for treatment severity is important. You may require inhaled bronchodilators. No need to worry much for septal thickening in both lungs.

input: Hi, I am 22 years old and I have lost 50 pounds on the ChatDoctor diet in the last 70 days, 5 days ago I was having some chest pain for about 3 hours, than today I had the same thing could it be from eating broccoli? It sure feels like a gas problem because I feel like I just want to belch all the time. Also when I bend over sometimes I get a small pain on the right side of my chest on my rib cage? Any answers?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of acute gastritis and gaseous bloating is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily.4. Go for walking after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent gas reflux.6. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: hii..i had my last periods on 16 jan.. we had sex on 23 jan and condom leaked inside. i took unwanted 72 on 25 jan..still not got periods... normally cycle is 28 days.. i neither have symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, tenderness in breast or other common symptoms...only sometimes having feeling same as pre-menstruation cycle...m i pregnant??
output: Hello, Thanks for writing to us. You did safe sex on 23rd Jan as per last period date and took Unwanted 72 pill on 25th Jan, which will give extra protection. In this case, your chance of pregnancy is NIL due to safe period. Your late period is MOSTLY due to hormonal imbalance (effect of the pill) and mental stress. Period may be delayed for 1-2 weeks. On negative test, you have to wait for coming period naturally. If your period doesn't start within 2 weeks, you must undergo one pelvic ultrasound scan and hormone test to pinpoint the diagnosis. You may require progesterone pill to induce period. Kindly, consult with your gynecologist and take complete prescription. You should control body wt, avoid stress, take healthy low carboy Chat Doctor. Good luck and take care. Be well.

output: HiT hanks for being on Chat Doctor.comas you are having pain in lower spine region, I would like to know if this pain radiates to any of your legs. Also, do you have numbness or abnormal sensations in your legs? If yes, that may be a pinched nerve in your spine, and you might need an MRI of lumbosacral spine to evaluate the same. Otherwise, also, MRI will help in diagnosing. Chat Doctor.

Stopping at the bottom portion of the left side of my chest! The People at The ER drew Blood samples, did an EKG, ran X-Rays And said I was not having a Heart attack! Which I Trust and Believe is True! Even after all the Pain Medication they gave me at the ER, I had no relief from the Severe pain! I am not worried about the pain, as much, as to what this Ailment might be? I also have Numbness from my Elbow down to my finger tips! I have not had any recent Injuries! No Severe Coughing fits? I have quit smoking about a month ago? I have no Dizziness, nor am I lightheaded! Just the Severe Pain on the left side of my chest, with numbness from my left elbow down to my finger tips! Any Suggestions, of what it could be?
output: Howell come to ChatDoctorOf course this is typical symptoms which may be suggestive of cardiac disease could be because of ischemia, if the EKG is unremarkable then this does not rule out the possibility of ischemia but this need to differentiated with the help of trade mill test, ECHO, and if possible coronary angiography need to be done, if these test are unremarkable then it can be said that this is not the cardiac disease, till then condition can be treated with Tab Omeprazole 40 mg and Tab Risperidone 30 mg once in day, hope this information helps, take care.

Ever since, my thoracics and lumbar has been a problem. I have been to the chiropractor repeatedly since and the problem always seems to come back within a week. I went to my doctor and he diagnosed a muscle sprain and put me on somas, but they do not help. Also, a few weeks ago I was putting on a pair of boots and heard a snap in my very lower back...followed by alot of pain. What should I do?
output: Hi, It is quite common to have these types of pain persisting for quiet a lot of time in absence of proper treatment. All you need to do is to give rest to your back, avoid over exertion and lifting heavy weights. Along with warm saline fomentation twice a day, consult a physio also for ultrasonic therapy. If all these doesn't proves to be effective then get an X-ray of the affected part done. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: I am 55 years old I went to have my mamogram test done in 2011 January and the Tech told me she saw something there and when she did the test over she did it so hard that my breast hurt really bad and could not sleep well that night until i drank some pain tablets so to get some sleep,and April Month end of that same year  i started to feel very sick and serious pain in both breast and went to my Family Physician and explained my conditioned to him and he did not handle my condition well and i am still in pain with both breast, cannot eat as i used to, blotted all the time,pain in both arms and under. please help with this condition that i am going through. Lost weight very rapidly in my whole body and still he never tried to send me to see an Oncologist because those type of Doctors are only for people who is diagnose with Cancer of the breast and it takes a year to see one. How did he know that the Radiologist did not see a lump and that is the reason why she did the test over again and send it all over my body which i had said to him but still ignore my request to send me to see that specialist. I think ur  Physician should listen to their patient wish and tried to help them,because is the patient who is feeling ill and knows all about there body as soon as possible. I am still suffering. Thanks and please give me your in put.
output: If your mammogram is normal and if you don't feel any lump when you self examine your breast, it is very unlikely you have breast cancer. Maybe that is why you are not referred to an oncologist. Regular exercises and Yoga might help you

input: My husband had elevated liver enzymes app 4 years ago, his dr at the time thought related to taking Chantix. After the med was discontinued, levels were followed a few times, they were trending down so his dr said not to monitor the levels any more. He had levels drawn again this week and his ALT was 112, AST 46. How concerning is this?
output: Hi, elevated enzymes specially we need to think first is Hepatitis B and C, and we need to think of fatty liver too, IF they ARE NORMAL THEN THINK OF WILSON DISEASE WORK UP WITH SERUM CERULOPLASMIN, 24 HOUR URINARY COPPER AND AN OPHTHALMOLOGY OPINION to rule out K F Ring by slit lamp examination.

input: I am still dealing with mid to lower abdominal pain which started in June 2012. I have seen doctors and had lots of tests, but so far no diagnosis. The pain was sporadic until December 2013. Then it became more intense - more painful and more often. Now it s almost constant. I have had issues with constipation for years due to my need to take narcotic medication for chronic pain (reflex sympathetic dystrophy, lymphedema, arthritis, etc.) In 12/13 my medication was changed and the pain in my abdomen became my new chronic pain, overtaking the other pain, which while still there, is not as prominent. My pain medication has been adjusted, but the pain remains. While I was being tested to find what was causing the stomach/abdomen pain I was diagnosed with leukemia (CCL) which apparently is not related. The question is what is causing my pain? Stress makes it worse, and while constipation may be an issue, the pain became worse after my colonoscopy & endoscopy. I have also had a CT Scan, PET Scan, intestine scan, can t have a MRI due to a spinal cord implant. So far these things have also been ruled out, IBS, hernia, no vaginal issues, gastritis. My doctor thinks it might be muscle spasms. I have been keeping a food diary and I have not found any discernible patterns or any clues. Could it be some sort of food or substance allergy? HELP
output: Well, as your investigations are normal, nothing much to worry. Keep healthy eating habits. High fiber diet, plenty of liquids, avoid constipation, keep relaxed, probably you will get relief.

output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Most anti-epileptic medications including Deal (Valerie acid) affect liver function, however, based on the information you have given your liver function is certainly improving (decrease in SGPT and GOT) indicating that your treatment is going in the right direction. However, your triglyceride level is still high. I recommend increasing the dose of Amoco and repeating your lipid profile after a couple of months. In this regard I will advise you to consult your primary physician and monitor your lipid profile as well as liver function. Hope this helps.

input: Hi Doctor, shall I use flutivate cream for my 1 year baby? She is having rashes in her legs and when we consulted the doctor he told that because of milk only this kind of allergy will come. And also he prescribed flutivate cream.. When I check the internet it shows some side effect and also mentioned not used for children (Fluticasone Propionate). So, I m in confusion. Please clear it.
output: Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Cultivate contains a steroid called fluticasone which is intended to reduce an inflammatory allergic manifestation as exhibited by the rashes. Apply it as per your doctors' advice. It is hard to comment without looking at the rashes but might be needed. It can be used in child Chat Doctor. Such allergies may occur not only in response to milk but also practically anything that we are exposed to, things like dust, pollen etc. If your doctor advises milk free diet, you can include formula like Zero lac. But after semisolid have been introduced in the diet, milk can be avoided anyway. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert in case of further queries if any.

input: my brother is 44 years old two days ago he passed out no breath pale and he remained like this for 2 minutes or may be more or less . his echo graph is normal and doctor found a cyst on his kidney .his blood pressure was  160/ 10..can you please let me know why he passed out like this .
output: Hi, I understand your concern and I'll try to help you. The sudden loss of frame of consciousness that you reported is compatible with syncope. There are several causes of syncope is the most common type is the vasovagal syncope, but there are also syncopation of origin for cardiac arrhythmias and neurological diseases. The picture of your brother has several characteristics of vasovagal syncope, but the information you reported is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. This type of syncope is often triggered by stress such as fear of needles, fear of heights, long periods of standing and in the same position, hot and stuffy places. Usually there is complete loss of consciousness, which can last a few seconds and the patient wakes up slowly, often with nausea and dizziness, and skin pallor and general ma-being. After a few minutes the person is totally normal. This all occurs by stimulation of the autonomic nervous system that causes bradycardia (reduction in frequency of heartbeat and Chat Doctor. To confirm this diagnosis and away from others is necessary look for a good Cardiologist to make a detailed medical history and discard cardiac and neurological causes. So I use some additional tests beyond echocardiography, holder as 24 hours, exercise testing, in some cases the tilt test and if there are signs of neurological causes, request a cranial tomography and evaluation neurologist. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help you. Wish you good health.

input: sir, I am feeling burning/pinching and twisting in my nervous and muscles in left side and in chest area. I have shown to doctors, they did ECG and told that it is not heart problem...and asked me to apply pain gel to reduce it..but the problem persists...please advise..
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be related to a musculoskeletal pain. Inflammation or an electrolyte imbalance can not be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend performing further tests: - PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation- blood electrolytes including calcium to exclude possible imbalance. Meanwhile, I recommend taking ibuprofen. I would also advise you to closely monitor the skin in this region for possible eruptions. Shingles can cause similar symptoms before eruptions.  Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards,

input: hi i had my wisdom teeth pulled out five years ago. i recently went for a dental check up and the dentist said i have an abnormality on my bottom right side where my wisdom tooth was removed,like a bump he said.so he referred me to a specialist..i have no pain and the bump is not visible when i see inside my mouth..what could this be?

input: Hi, I m a 14 year old black girl . I used to have acne for 2 years but it has gone now but I have been left with hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, upper arms and upper back. I am currently using Lush products (only cleanser, toner and moisturiser) which have been working well. However, I would like a very effective solution that would hopefully solve my hyperpigmentation please. Thank you.
output: Hello thanks for using Chat Doctor .  I would be pleased to answer your question For the hyperpigmentation, the best option is to get your skin exfoliated by a better method like a glycolic acid peel done every 15 days. A better option for you would be to visit a Dermatologist to avail of these peels. Alternative peel treatments like trichloroacetic acid are also very useful. I would suggest you get your skin examined by the dermatologist.  For a home based treatment, Application of vitamin C based serum can be safe over long run. Thanks and take care.

Chemo and other traditional treatments didnt work and now are about to start some sort of experimental medication. They are in alot of pain and has lost approx 35 libs. said to be moving around a little better since chemo was stopped but now has a blood clot around where chemo was admitted. I am scared it is getting close to the end but not for sure as I dont know much about this horriable disease. Please help me understand. They have not discussed her chances with the family or her yet. Does that mean that the point of survival is mute ? how long could she have left ?
output: There is almost no hope to prolong life beyond a certain period of time.without complications we cans til hope for some changes in the outlook, but if already witChatDoctorplications, then very difficult to say the outcome.discuss the possibilities with the treating doctor who knows the patient the best, so he/she will be th the best person to discuss the outcomes of the disease.

What can I do to help myself heal and what should i steer clear of (obviously razors and depilatories) till i heal?Thank you.
output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It can take 2 to 3 days for the symptoms to decrease. You can use site baths to see if it helps. This would involve sitting in a site bath with warm (not hot) water for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times daily. Normally table salt or Epsom salt is added to the water. The use of anti-inflammatory painkillers would also help e.g. naproxen, ibuprofen or Catalan hope this helps

input: Embarrasing to ask...my rectum burns and itches really bad. For a year now it gets really sore after a movement. I wipe really hard, so I may have caused damage.?? I can wipe until clean and an hour later I burn and itch and wipe again and it s like I never wiped the first time....
output: Hi, From history it seems that there might be having some local skin infection like dermatitis or yeast infection. Due to lack of personal local hygiene this problem might be there. Clean the part gently without giving more pressure and apply triple action cream. Take Cetirizine or Levi cetirizine for itching. In absence of itching there will be speedy healing. Take plenty of water. Avoid constipation. Clean local part with running tap water thoroughly. Ok and take care.

input: i have a good friend with multiple myeloma.  he suddenly has developed a raspy voice.  He has multiple hairline fractures in his spine and ribs and has become quite stooped and seems to have difficulty breathing.  Is the raspy voice related to the condition of his spine
output: Hi, Thanks fir writing in. A raspy voice is due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve which supplies the vocal cords. It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat. The raspy voice is not related to his spine but might have an indirect association to his treatment which he is getting right now. Please do not worry.

input: HI, my mother is 56 years old and has been having darkly pigmented patches on both the cheeks for almost 5 years now. is it safe to use candid B cream on the face or any other medication for it? have tried alot of ointments but none have been effective.
output: Hello, i would strongly recommend you not use Candid B cream for the dark pigmentation on your mothers cheek. Candid B cream is an antifungal cream with steroid. This cream is used only in specific dermatological conditions as prescribed a qualified physician. There are a variety of skin disorders causing dark pigmentation. The commonest cause of dark pigmentation on cheeks in an elderly lady is a condition called Plasma. The cause of plasma is complex. There is a genetic predisposition to plasma, with at least one-third of patients reporting other family members to be affected. In most people plasma is a chronic disorder.  Sun exposure, pregnancy, hormonal changes, photo-toxic reaction to Scented or deodorant soaps, toiletries and cosmetics or medications are the commonest triggering factors of Plasma. There are different modalities of treatment for Plasma and I would recommend you to consult a qualified Dermatologist for an expert opinion regarding your mothers skin condition and treatment.

input: Hi iam 34years. We are trying for a baby for the past 1 year... my periods were regular and my doctor said my ovulation is normal. I had been taking folic acid supplements only. I did foliicular study for about 5 months ina row and everything was normal. Recently my last cycle ended up being an anovulatory cycle. I got my regular periods without any delay. My bleeding was also normal. My husbands reports are normal too. All mu harmonal blood tests were normal, the same month i had anovulation. Is thus possible. What is happening to me?
output: Hi I think you can take some medicines like camphene for inducing ovulation.  Track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupture of follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles.

input: Hi Dr. Good afternoon,I am a survivor of Squmousa cell carcinoma of the tongue two years back.  Recently there are two neck lumps visible and MRI scans confirms the enlargements.  Is it a sign of metastates??? What should I do further to confirm it?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. Possibilities of metastases can not be ruled out (in your case) without an FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology of an enlarged lymph nodes.2. Generally lymph nodal enlargement is seen after local or systemic, infection or inflammatory cause. And ease off after treatment.3. You have done MRI - it would have given you the status of the old treated tongue malignancy. A computer tomography with contrast will help to see the status of previous malignancy.4. Get an ultrasound abdomen done - to see the status of liver and abdominal lymph nodal enlargement.5. Get an FNAC of lymph node for confirmation and treatment to commence. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

If I can control this moment, I continue for a good long period. Because of this unsure intercourse, I feel of the fear that I may not satisfy my partner .Can you mention the treatment for this type of early ejaculation .I am free from any ailments.Frequently I ride Stationary cycling. Thank you very much,,,
output: Dear sir, thank you for writing in. Welcome to the forum. You can try the squeeze technique, start stop technique or use an anesthetic condom. A number of medications such as Dallas, flu nil or next are also useful. Please remember that while using the squeeze or start stop technique, the key thing is to initiate action when a mild sense of ejaculating occurs but well before you sense a loss of control. It is better to err towards the former. Thanks.

I cant be able to concentrate on my work as lot of destruction keeps on hitting my mind away from the work. I discussed about it with my friend earlier through online chat, she asked to consult a female psychiatrist as my problem is related to females. So please advice me a doctor to look after my problem and it shouldn t be expensive as I don t possess lot of money.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  You have not mentioned your age. Concentration problems do arise to people at every stage, but it is more present with young adults. You are supposed to refer to concentration and attention as two. Attention span for any adult is maximum 30 minutes. Sometimes, a person can be attentive to an interesting thing for more than 30 minutes, such as movies or games. Concentration is attention plus understanding. For this too, span of below 30 minutes. If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do. So please be passionate towards what you are doing or do only those things which you are interested in. It is also possible to improve your concentration level with the help of yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

input: Hello Doctor,I am 7 weeks pregnant although when did an u/s scan it came out as 5-6 weeks of pregnancy.(My periods are normal 27-28 days cycle). There was no fetal pole and heartbeat but a gestational , yolk sac is seen. Doctor has advised scan after 10 days and said this will be the max waiting time for a fetal heartbeat. I am advised to take hormonal tablets (Conest). I am very much worried and really hoping the best for my baby. Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.
output: Hallow Dear, Usually by 6 weeks or so the fetal pole and fetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks, it is undetectable, there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle, which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case, the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well-rounded, in order to exclude the first two causes, it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty, then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However, if the edges are corrugated, it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously, termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you.

Three are solid and 1 with fluid. Had biopsy done early in April of this year and they were benign. My question and concern is can they eventually become cancer if they are not taken care of?

It was so painful I couldn t move at all but put my arm in bent position curled against me. After going to the doctor she said it was a MRSA infection and opened it up and drained it.

input: About 6 months ago I developed fatigue and wheezing. I am 67 with a history of cardiac problems. I was born with Fallot s Tetralogy which was corrected in 1964 in Bristol. It was very successful and I have had nearly 50 years of almost complete health, firstly as a teacher, and then as a vicar. I retired 2 years ago sadly because I had devloped an alcohol problem so I now live in care and haven t drunk since last August. When the wheezing began I automatically assumed it was due to a worsening of the residual faults from my Fallot s correction. I have lived with a small VSD, pulmonary stenosis and some atrial regurge. But having spent a week in hospital having echo tests , e.c.g, x-ray etc. the team failed to find any deterioration that would cause the things I am experiencing. A few weeks ago , however, I became aware of a hard lump under my right nipple. Not really painful but a bit sore. So I wonder if it s possible that I might have Male Breast cancer (however rare) and whether the wheeze, tightness of chest and breathlessness might be due to that. I don t want to bother my GP unnecessarily but on the other hand if it is a carcinogenic lump I would like to seek any treatment that might be available to me. Thank you. Rev. Robert Pitcher.
output: His would advise you to do a PET scan. If any space occupying lesion is found then biopsy has to be done to rule out cancer.

input: Good evening. I have recently had a challenge test to sulfa and was extremely allergic to it after 4 hours. I have not had my follow up appt with my allergist yet but scheduled in two weeks. If I am allergic to sulfa, does that mean I must be careful with products containing sulfite, sulfate and sulfur? I know that I did use bactrim (which has the sulfa) before having the challenge test and that reaction is what prompted the challenge. How about Desonide cream which contains aluminum sulfate? Thank you in advance for responding to my question. Barbara

input: I have a raised region on left side just below ribs. I went to the doctor he felt my abdominal region said there was nothing to worry about. However I still have this lump or swollen area. It s not painful but sometimes uncomfortable I have to lift my left shoulder up. I m thinking it could be my posture but this wouldn t cause swelling. It s slightly noticeable what could it be??
output: Hi, as mentioned by you, about the swollen or lump area, and also examined by doctor where he said It's nothing to worry.of course I agree to you that how come something comes up like this and is painful. And also how come the swelling is persisting. What I would suggest is to undergo an x-ray and check as it may reveal something with it. Maybe a fluid accumulation. Also, later on an MRI will guide to see what soft tissues are involved in that area leading to swelling. Until we get a picture of the soft tissue abnormality it will be really tough for anyone to examine and comment. As diagnostic holds the strong ground for assistance. I wish you get an MRI done, so we can come to know what sort of soft tissue is involved a muscular or a lung tissue. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryregardsJay In Chat Doctor. 

input: Last year I was operated for cholecystectomy the year after I again had that severe abdomen pain and was hospitalised for 15 days in ICU , diagnoised with CBD sludge thereafter on udiliv.  After 3 month I again had blood test and amylase was quoted 407.3 after 3 days again the same test was taken and amylase reading was 242.9 and lipase 37 .  Doctor has advised for ERCP.  My question is if the sludge is still there does not udiliv help in flushing it out, if not for what purpose has it been recommended to me.  Whether ERCP is the only cure?
output: Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Udiliv is a Chat Doctor.  However, this is not a 100% cure for it. Even though the pancreatic enzymes have come out to be within the normal range or of decreasing level, there possibly is a suspicion of pancreatitis by your treating physician, and also to know the complete anatomy of biliary tree along with the pancreatic duct, an ERCP is advised. This would be a near confirmatory investigation to rule out the biliary tree and the pancreatic system as the cause of your abdominal pain. ERCP could also be of therapeutic nature if the sludge/calculi in any of the biliary tree is endoscopic-ally removed. Till then, you could go for some anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor 

input: I had gone through Radiotherapy after surgery of tongue for squamous cell carcinoma about 20 months ago, Now I my TSH level has gone up and it is  7.69, I have been advised Eltroxin 50 . OD. Another doctor has advised Thyronorm 50 OD.. Could you guide me which is a better medicine. YYYY@YYYY
output: You have hypothyroidism secondary to radiation therapy to neck. It requires replacement of thyroid hormones. Both Elton and Thermoform contain levothyroxine. Elton is more expensive than thermoform. If you do not have affordability issues I would suggest Elton as I have found it to be very effective in my patients and is well known to be a quality brand.

input: hello sir,i m 27 years old single male.i used to masturbate very frequently n the frequency was nearly 4 to 5 days in a week.now i feel the erection is not that much hard as it was before n even suffering PME. i  even afraid regarding less sperm count n cum (sperm) is also not thick.please suggest me as what step should i take.Plz help.Regards...
output: Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. Let me assure you, masturbation is not unhealthy. Masturbation is normal and natural. Frequency of 4 or 5 times a week masturbation is pretty normal and not in excess. Therefore, masturbation is not the reason for your present problem. I think you are obsessing with your sexual ability and sexual organ. Unless you are actually in sexual intercourse, you cannot judge your hardness. Secondly, when you try to test your hardness, the hardness comes down, because at that moment, you are diverting from sexual thoughts. The reason for your present problem is simply psycho-logic and never organic. I suggest you to consult a psychologist for sexual counseling. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible. Hope this answers your query.

output: Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. These could be a manifestation of depression. You will need some benzodiazepine and SSRI medications like Escitalopram or mirtazapine to help with your problems. Some psychotherapy will also help.

input: My wife age 38 is HBV positive with acute measure and Dr. has told that she is not in carrier stage and does not need any treatment. The quantitive test result somewhere 625. Can this HBV get removed completel, does this quantity increases in future, what could be the effect on liver functioning in future. Please explain.
output: Thank you for posting query. Carrier state means that your wife is infected with Herb (Bag positive) but the replicating antigen of virus maybe negative and the viral load may NOT be high enough requiring treatment. Virus is in "dormant" phase. It is possible that the virus remains in dormant phase throughout and causes no harm to liver. Only one fourth of patients infected with Herb virus develop liver cirrhosis. Therefore, one cannot be sure about her status. The viral load should be monitored, and she needs to repeat test every 6 month or at least once a year. You should also inform your treating doctor if you want to plan a baby. There is NO permanent treatment for Herb virus. However, all relatives of your wife including you need to be vaccinated against Herb (if not done yet).wish her good health. Further queries are welcomed. Health professionals aim to diagnose properly and manage patients according to their limited knowledge. Cure is blessed by the ONE who Created us, whose power and knowledge is unlimited .wish you good health. Regards, Chat Doctor.

input: Dr. Agarwal, is wrong, I have an MRI that says that I have a S1-S2 intervertebral disc space. My Question is how much does this affect my lower back pain? I have very bad pain (level 8+) almost continually, and difficulty with other functions. I Know that I, have some pretty serious disc damage from L-5 through T-12. But here lately it s gotten much worse.
output: Disc degeneration may lead to back pain however there are too many pain generators in spine, so we need to know more about your complaints and the MRI images to tell you exactly what is the possible reason for back pain. Although you have disc space at S1-S2 but it's not necessary that it is the pain generator. Usually there is no motion at this level, so it may not cause any back pain. Few other reasons could be last mobile lumbar level disc prolapse or sacroiliac joint inflammation. I would suggest getting back WTH more detailed history and your MRI images. Thanks.

input: I m 76 years old and about 5 days ago I started feeling a really sharp pain on the right upper part of my knee. I ve been limping because walking is extremely painful and if I sit for too long I have to stand and wait a while before I can walk....what might this pain be or mean and what should I do?
output: Hello, As you are 76 and having pain in the upper part of the knee, have you ever taken an x-ray. Because there should be some degenerative changes of the knee joint and the ligament injuries.  Having an MRI or X-ray will be of God choice to understand the pathology.  As this pain makes you slow down and locks you up while taking instant movement I will advise you to use the knee brace and do hot water fermentation.  Because the muscle spasms need to be corrected, and also the weaker muscles needs support, so the inflammation over the knee joint internal structures do not go high.  Also doing some simple exercises like - static Qua Chat Doctor.  Additional exercises like straight leg raise on supine lying and side lying will be of benefits. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most geriatric cases reported with similar pain are advised for exercise in low intensity. They respond well. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In

input: I lost my significant other 3 years ago and can t seem to get through grieving. We were having quiet time together and then he went to sleep on the sofa and I went to bed. The next morning I found him dead. I keep reliving this over and over again. I feel I might have missed something or he tried to get to me but was unable to. I cant get this picture out of my head and I can t see me loving someone else. I dont know how to move on. I feel my life has been turned upside down since then. I have family I am around yet I feel so alone. I feel like I don t belong anywhere. I am not suicidal; I cannot do that to my 3 children and grandchildren. Yet life is hard for me. I am also unemployed and having a hard time finding a job. I am experiencing things I have never dealt with and am having a hard time. What can I do?

Secondly, you were doing the same for the last three years. That is great. If you have any mental disorders, you cannot do so. You must add to your self-confidence. What you can do now is, understand what life is. Even you are a guest here. Your spouse went because his time had come. When your time comes, you shall also join him. That is life.

input: Hi,I am 24 years old.i had my last period on the 2nd of july and it lasted about 4 days. I had unprotected intercourse on the 12th of july and I used postinor 2 1 hour after.i dont keep track of my menstrual cycle but I am scared of getting pregnant. I dont have any symptomsjust being having cramps.pls help me.
output: Hello, please do keep record of your menstrual cycle to predict the day of ovulation and decide the safe and unsafe period for yourself. If you had regular cycles then ovulation takes place 14 days prior to the start if next menstruation. 4 days before and 4 days after ovulation is the unsafe period in which couples should avoid having intercourse. If you have a regular cycle of 30 days then you had sex in safe period plus you took posting 2 within 24 hours which means very less chance of getting pregnant. Posting has its side effects as well, so these cramps might be due to the medicine.

This behavior has started within the past 3 to 4 months. I am 85 years old. I have a heart condition and arthritis and take several medications that can cause tiredness and dizziness but I have been on these medications for a very long time. Had a cardiac oablation done in September of 2013; could this have been the start of this tiredness & dizziness? Thank you.

I have been drinking a fair amount of water and cranberry juice to help clear out any infections that may be present.  is there any other suggestions that could help with my problem that would not require a professional?

input: What causes shingles (other than the compromised immune system)...poor nutrition, stress, lack of sleep? My 76 year old man friend just broke out and he will see a doctor tomorrow, but I would like to know the why and how we treat it. Am I liable to become infected if we are intimate? What is the incubation period? What is the standard treatment, please? Is the condition likely to return again? Thank you. Gina email: YYYY@YYYY
output: Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Shingles generally happens due to a virus that sleeps in the neurological system on a person that has had chicken pox before. This is very common especially in cases you mention, but elderly age is a reason also. It is generally self limiting but very uncomfortable meanwhile. There is oral acyclovir he might use to speed up healing, it should be started as soon as possible and there are Chat Doctor.  Local cold compresses can help with pain also. As for you, you are not in risk if you are not in contact with the fluids that come from the vesicles. Very little chance it will spread to you by contact, it generally comes from the inside of the patient (the sleeping virus) but to be safe please try to avoid contact with the area that has the vesicles. I hope this is helpful and answers to your question, but please feel free to write us in case more clarification is needed on this. Kind regards, Antoneta Total, MD

input: I was doing some sweeping of my house yesterday. Ever since the I have been extremely dizzy. I have had at least 9 concussions and have neck issues. I also have 2 buldging discs and have had a compression fracture of my spine. I have done some research and think it could be Cervical Vertigo.
output: Hi, From history it seems that this problem might be due to pinched nerve pressure due to problem in your cervical spines. While giving uneven pressure on neck like sweeping or nodding movement at neck might give pressure causing nerve irritation producing pain or vertigo. Go for neck exercises, cervical traction, short way diathermy etc. Avoid putting pillow under the neck while sleeping. Ok and take care.

input: I do masturbation in prone way by lying down against pillow of floor. I never had any problem with this method. However, I have read that doing masturbation  in this method puts pressure on penis and people who do that will not have good pleasure during normal sex. Is it true?
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry. The position you are taking is safe and normal. People invent numerous methods and most common are hand masturbation and your style. This method is adopted by millions across the globe and none of them had this problem. You can enjoy sexual life for sure. There is one advantage with hand masturbation. After some time, the penis slightly bends towards right or left. This bend penis shaft gives more pleasure during sexual intercourse than straight penis. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

Any suggestions? Thanks,Robbin
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Squamous cell cancer of the sinus cavity might become recurrent in some people. It is important that you follow up with your doctor and then get evaluated for possible recurrence.

About 58% of local recurrences manifest within 1 year, 83% within 3 years, and 95% within 5 years. Please consult your doctor at the earliest and take treatment should there be any recurrence. Please do not worry.

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you were a smoker, we should rule out lung infection and bronchitis in your case. Both these diseases are common in smokers and cause similar symptoms like cough, expectoration, fever and breathlessness. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x-ray 3. PUT (pulmonary function test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

input: After training for a half marathon last year, I discovered what feels like a small lump behind my shin. I feels very bruised when I push into it and can give me a bit of discomfort. I massage it frequently and feel like it is gradually getting smaller. Should I continue doing this or get it checked out?

input: what should i do about severe body /arm and leg tremors. Im scared to take any medications that i was prescribed for sleep/depression/anxiety because of this severe tremoring . I have been basically totally inactive for weeks and lost about 4 kilos and i think this may have caused the tremors because my heart feels extremely weak. I dont want to cause a further problem by taking a medication for 2 weeks. Should i get my heart and cardiovascular system checked before taking and medications. It feels like i am almost going to have a heart attack when i lay down and my whole chest tremors.I even fear i may have already had a small heart attack or something. im 37 and my appearance looks normal/a bit thin. What specific tests should i get done?
output: The tremors in arms/legs and chest tremors (palpitations) are likely to be due to anxiety. You should give a trial to the medicine prescribed by your doctor. At this stage, in my opinion, the symptoms are likely to be due to an anxiety disorder. When you follow up with your doctor, you may ask questions you may have about specific medicines. You may consult a psychiatrist if your doctor is a general practitioner. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor specializing in psychological and behavioral disorders (including neurological disorders with psychological symptoms). A psychiatrist is in the best position to judge what tests to order in the beginning and whether to seek additional consultation of a cardiologist or any other specialist. I hope this answers your question.

My doctor had prescribed me levolin as an emergency medication ,budate as my regular medication along with a tablet of montair lc every night(tablets for two weeks). The montair lc make me feel much better and keep me covered the whole day and i do not even need to take my inhalers.

output: Hi.First there cannot be a cancerous spot on the spleen. IN a patient who is 85 years this can be due to an infarct or hematoma. And cause severe pain. Since you have given history related to food habits and taste, it is possible she has other forms of gastrointestinal disease, which needs a thorough investigation. I would advise CT scan of the abdomen, upper GI Endoscopy and tests of blood, urine and stool. I can understand the feeling you have about your Mother. If there is no cancer, she can live much longer.

input: i took a abdominal scan in which i got a liver measuring 13.0 cms with impression of mild hepatomegaly with fatty changes and divarication of recti with small umbilical hernia defect size 8 mm, anteverted and bulky uterus. what is my problem exactly? I have abdominal pain for past 10 days in my upper right stomach and around the navel.
output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The ultrasound found mild enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) with deposition of fat in the liver. Fatty liver is one of the more common causes of liver disease presently, it may reverse if lifestyle changes are made or progress to inflammation of the liver. The lifestyle changes would be increased activity and dietary changes such as reduced carboy Chat Doctor. Variation of the recto refers to separation of some muscles in the abdomen (the rectus abdominis). An umbilical hernia is a protrusion through a defect in the umbilicus. The anteverted uterus is not concerning and would not cause any issues. A uterus can be bulky for different reasons such as fibroid, pregnancy, endometriosis, adenomyosis, molar pregnancy, cancer. It is possible that the hernia is the cause of your pain particularly since the pain is around the navel. I hope this helps

It is not so. The best way for you will be that - Consult a genetics specialist (both of you) and get evaluated and then take a decision of the marriage. Regards -

My fingers sooth me and keep me calm so i can sleep in a way nothing else can. i only do it at night and when im really tired.. please help
output: Hi and welcome, Finger sucking and thumb sucking habit is very injurious as dental health is concerned. Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth.  Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and bite problems.  You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly.  Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. You can follow few steps to avoid the habit :Ask your family member to carefully remove your fingers from mouth during sleep Don't be in anxiety or fear. If you have any emotional problems, or under stress, and you need comforting, you may need to resolve those issues first before successfully stopping the habit.  Use a finger sucking guard. - your dentist might suggest the use of special devices to stop thumb sucking, called finger guards. A finger or thumb guard is a device with a plastic cover of the thumb that is attached to wrist. . Treatment with thumb guards usually lasts four weeks and helps to stop thumb sucking successfully. I hope this helps, take care

input: I have been diagnosed with biceps tendinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis of the right shoulder following a vehicle accident over 7 months ago and despite a steroid injection and months of physical therapy, I can barely move my right shoulder, is there any real help for this?
output: Hello, As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry.

input: Doctor, I have a flaring toothache caused by tooth infection, its a saturday night so the dentist is not open tomorrow. However I have come Calvepen left over from when I had tonsilitis. Would this provide any temporary relief before I can get to the dentist?
output: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Calvepen is antibiotic (penicillin) which is used to treat infections.

Do salt water gargling. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards.

output: Hi, I think you can try naturally for 6 months. Be in contact with your partner every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  If your periods are regular, you can conceive naturally.

Off late I have felt very burnt out due to work stress, have had lot of mood swings (there are days when I feel depressed, feel like crying), cant get any work done.

He has told me that both medications will be stopped at the end of 2 weeks.He has also put me on a multivatimin tab & Omega-3 supplement. Do these medications sound correct for my problem? What are the side effects & withdrawal symtomns? Vikram
output: HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor I think, you have adjustment disorder or depression. In that case, you need antidepressant with low dose benzodiazepine.

input: hi i am a 33 yr old fem. and have a kidney infection caused by proteus and I am on my 5th day of anitibiotics (Cipro). The pain is almost gone as well as the high fever, but i have been extremely dizzy. I was expecting that to subside with the other symptoms, is this normal? i just dont quite feel right.
output: Dizziness is not likely to be due to the infection unless OT is so severe that it had reduced your BP, but that is now unlikely considering that you feel the fever had come down. Ciprofloxacin is an excellent Chat Doctor.  You can take a multivitamin preparation for whatever it is worth as well. I suggest you take plenty of fluids and eat well for the next couple of days till you complete your antibiotics course but if you are not comfortable, please stop the antibiotic and get yourself examined by a doctor.

input: My mother is 77yo. She had most of her bowel removed 4 months ago due to cancer. At the time she was diagnosed as stage 4, as it had spread to her lungs and liver. The latter is now quite enlarged and she experiences severe intermittent pain. Recently a clear sticky fluid has begun weeping from her skin, around the eyes and neck, with a significant amount now coming from the lower legs. This morning there was also blood trickling from her calf, her feet have become a very dark shade of purple.I have called the palliative care people, who dismiss it as "the progression of the disease". What causes this? Can it be treated? is it a sign she is nearing the end of her life?
output: HiT hanks for your query. It appears that she is at the terminal stage of her disease. This current problem may be due to low protein in blood or compromised skin integrity or a coagulation abnormality. I am afraid there is no specific treatment for this and the doctors who have evaluated her are the best persons to suggest if there is any. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: Hi, my daughter age 19 just returned from Uganda. She is experiencing pain at her back rib on lft side. A phys therapist that was on the trip thought she may have popped a rib. She has no insurance. We can go to an urgent care facility but they dont have xray. Would that be required for treatment?  Thanks.
output: GREETINGS! ANSWER : Fracture or dislocation of the rib can be only confirmed through X-ray. If it's a fracture or dislocation then, There is no specific treatment for rib fractures, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this! Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of assisted ventilation. Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying viscera (e.g., lung contusion) or remotely (e.g., cervical spine injury). Other treatment includes internal fixation of rib!

input: Hi, I have a similar case to this one, in a 5 years old:my 3 year old child fainted today. she was outside in the hot sun and was eating an ice popsicle. she suddenly cried out. walked 2 feet to where her mother was and fainted. i picked her up straight away and she awoke. when asked she said she had a pain around the nasel area but does not remember fainting .any clue?I suspect vaso-vagal fainting due to the cold popsicle She had a similar case 3 years ago, which ended in pre-syncope. (she didnt faint as happened today...)In the last 3 years she has eaten hundreds of ice popsicles and ice creams, nothing happend....Thanks.
output: It might still be a vasovagal attack. Has your child any dental problems like fillings, etc.? Because the raw nerve roots at the base of the teeth are connected to the vagus nerve. When these nerve roots get irritated, she might experience a short period of fainting, but when they are not irritated, she might eat her entire ice cream without any problems.

I have been on the prescribed medication since Tuesday lunchtime and today the swelling is far more prominent and I am having difficulty opening my mouth.
output: Hello, Your infection is not under control and symptoms are increasing. Call your dentist to report that your condition has not improved and is worse. Your dentist will need to increase the dosage or change your antibiotic. Make sure you are following directions on taking all medication. I usually recommend Amoxicillin 500 mg or 875 mg depending on how often you take the antibiotic. Your dentist will recommend the next step for treatment of the abscess. You may need other oral conditions evaluated as well. Take anti-inflammatory medications in addition to the antibiotic. Tylenol and Motrin are effective choices.

output: Hi, As per your complaint it seems that ulcers on sides of tongue can to be due to Pathos Dermatitis leading to inflammation inside mouth and along with it there seem to be pathos ulcers or canker sores. It can be a side effect of the medication, other causes can be deficiency of iron and vitamin B12, stress, physical trauma to the tongue, allergies, acid reflux etc. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like blood tests can help in diagnosis. Treatment of underlying cause will relieve the symptoms. As of now, you can start gargling with a numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine to relieve the symptoms. You can also take a multivitamin tablet. You can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen. Suck ice and do cool water rinses. Avoid spicy food. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: my father experience numbness in his right hand after CABG 8 month ago. Doctor said it is normal side effect of post CABG. But my fther not happy with the numbness. so last week he start smoking ( he is a heavy smoker before but quit smoking after the CABG. he quit smoking for 8 month until recently ). He said the numbness gone after he start smoking. My question is, is nicotine or any substance in the cigarate have some effect on the the nerve or what so ever that can reduce or heal the numbness.TQ
output: Hello No it doesn't have any favorable effect on nerves, it's just his psychology and the urge to smoke in his subconscious that is making him feel in a better way. Smoking even after a CABG is highly inappropriate as smoking promotes atherosclerosis and can lead to a very early graft failure that could ultimately lead to a heart attack. So you have to make sure that he should stop smoking completely. Wish him good health Regards

input: basically i have been repeating myself alot lately i used to do it in the past but its been more common. its not like a stutter or stammer its only with one word out of a sentence. i will be speaking normally and then it hits me and i find my self repeating the word or sentance over and over sometimes even up to 20times. the wierdest thing is i can break away from saying it but to carry on telling the story i have to repeat it again. i was wondering if you have any answers as to what could be happening.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  From the description it is not easy to diagnose you properly. But I see a case of obsession here without any underlying physical / physiological cause. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and tried. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

input: 32yo female,smoker, taking 90mgs of generic adderall for the past 6months, got EKG came back normal-no other health problems. having heart palpitations since starting meds, feels like its skipping or stopping then goes back to normal, ck my BP numerous times a day- its always between 80s -90s.. now my left neck vein feels like it is throbbinig or something- and sometimes i can feel it in my left arm veins too. worried my heart is going to give out or something!!
output: Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So, nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards.

input: My 86 year old father just got out of the hospital after being diagnosed with anemia . His hemoglobin was 7.6 hematocrit was 23. He had a small bleed , I think they called it an AVM. They cauterized it, gave him one unit of blood and also gave him I ve iron. On Wednesday his hemoglobin was 8.8 and his hematocrit was 28.8. He had another 2 units of blood. He has experienced some foot pain lately, but this morning he got up to go to the bathroom and almost fell. He said the pain in his right foot was bad. I was reading up on and came across information that it could be from a B 12 deficiency. If this is so, Would they have seen this B 12 deficiency on his latest CBC or BMP?. He has has B 12 shots in the past, though I couldn t say when the last one was

input: Hi! My husband has a problem. He used a Veet Hair removal cream for all his body on saturday.(including the balls under penis) And next day he saw a blood in his urine. He told me is soo much:( When he wake up on Monday morning he saw a blood in his boxers. Is it possible to be reaction from Veet cream?Thank you
output: Hello, I can understand your concern for the blood in boxers of your husband after applying the meet cream. It appears that your husband has developed irritant dermatitis after applying the meet cream over the genital area. These creams are quite prone to cause the burn on the skin and therefore can cause damage leading to oozing of blood from the affected site. I suggest you to ask him to do cold compression over the affected area. Till the time you meet a family physician you can ask him to apply an antibiotic cream such as funding cream or mupirocin cream over the affected area. Ask him to wear lose cotton clothes so that it should not irritate the scrotal skin. All the best.

input: I have had very heavy and painful periods for many years.....I am trying to conceive right now (miscarried in November, ectopic in March which resulted in losing my right tube.....is there any chance for me and could the cause be rooted in my heavy, lumpy and painful periods?
output: Hallow Madam, Since you have conceived twice in your life, there are very good chances that you will conceive again. However, the history of ectopic pregnancy cannot be ignored, and you will have to be on the guard for it. The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected, the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you.

input: I have noticed for about the last 6 or so months when I sit down in a hard-back chair there is an area in the middle to lower section (about where my belly button would be) of my spine that begins to hurt. I have a bruise at the location of the pain -- probably because I am a student and my back is constantly being pressed against hard desk chairs. When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it. I don t have any serious history of either back or muscle issues. I do feel quite restless when sitting down -- I am constantly shifting. I also get the urge to crack my back at least two to three times per day. Any ideas about the pain in the one spot of my spine? Why is it sticking out? Thanks!
output: Hello ! I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion, or just the bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine. Other possible diagnosis, more rare may be lesions of the spine like tumors, cysts, etc. I would recommend you see a doctor and have a lumbar column x-ray and a blood routine test to rule out this diagnosis.

output: Hello Bad childhood experience, troubled relationships between parents are causing the disturbances in your behavior and relationships. Your close uncle tried to approach you and this resulted in fear of males. But presently you had relationship with a boy, so you have to move on. Childhood trauma results in conflict in mind, and it causes severe distress, and it can cause serious effects on personal and social life. I would advise you to please consult a good Psychiatrist for expert opinion and get your Psychotherapy done. Psychotherapy will resolve the unresolved conflict and will improve your condition. Life skill training is also needed. Try to do relaxation exercises and this will increase your confidence. Hope it solves your query. Thanks

I am 100 % sure about it , if i dont do masturbation for say 7 - 10 days then i dont get cold (allergy that is running nose and sneezing) for that period of time . Sneezing continouly for 20-25 times is too much to handle for me

Monte- LC (montelukast+cetirizine once daily at bedtime. All the best. Take care.

input: Hi,The inside right cheek of my mouth does not feel smooth as the left cheek, something like a very fine sandpaper feeling. I looked with a flashlight and it looks different than the left side. Gray cast rather than pink like the left side. It is hard to see close because of the limitations of my glasses and the mirror. Do you have any ideas? What kind of doctor would I make an appointment with. Would it be a dentist, GP, or something else?
output: Hello. Thank you for consulting Chat Doctor. You need to consult dentist for diagnosis of this lesion. According to symptoms you mentioned you can have leukoplakia/keratitis / lichen planes/ oral keratinizing candidiasis. I need to know your tobacco habits. I also need to know your gender and mental status either you are under any stress ? I also need to know are you taking any medicine regularly specially steroids ?perfectly the lesion can be diagnosed with microscopic examination of the infected tissues.

input: I have had burning mouth syndrome and burning in other mucous membranes. Are they related? I got this 9 years ago. It is so painful and it had subsided but started up again very suddenly 2 weeks ago. Is there any new information you could give me regarding treatment?
output: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query.

input: A few days ago, I pulled my lower back quite badly. Since then it seems to be healing with rest, ice and gentle exercise. However, a simultaneous problem has occurred that is causing a great deal of pain. I noticed that my bottom was also very painful, and when I looked there was a red and painful lump at the entrance to my anus. I took this to be a haemorrhoid. However, it is a very swollen and red perineum that is actually causing the pain. Is this related? Are they related to my back? And how can I treat it? At the moment, the combination of injuries means I can barely sit or sleep.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. I don't think your back pain and swelling at anal region are associated. By your history and description, your anal region swelling is mostly due to boil (skin infection). It is common in diabetic patients. So first rule out diabetes. Also consult surgeon and get done clinical examination. You need incision and Chat Doctor. 

input: Hello, I heard gargling hydrogen peroxide makes teeth white. I tried it, but shortly afterwards my nose started bleeding and also a little through my mouth. Is this a side affect of gargling hydrogen peroxide or may this be caused be something else?
output: Hello, Thanks for writing to shy Chat Doctor.  Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly, and when they do, retreating the teeth can easily be done. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards.

input: My 24 year old son was diagnosed with strep throat saturday and started antibiotics.  By Tuesday his stomach hurt so bad he went to ER....They said after an ultra sound that his gallbladder was swolen.   On the IV with antibiotics he felt bettter, now 12 hours later his stomach is bad again, he thinks its the antibiotics.  Im wondering if it is just anything he puts down his stomach affects his gallbladder????? Help I dont want another trip to er
output: Hello! Thank you for the query. Antibiotics quite often cause some gastrointestinal issues. Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer, ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP, and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found, gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards.

input: My boyfriend and i went to the building store about 1.5hrs ago and he started feeling really hot, he started sweating really badly and felt really light headed, hungry and thirsty. He is 19 years old what is wrong? he still does not feel like himselfhe gets hot and then cold and shakes and sweats
output: **1. Going by the time period and symptoms it could be acute stress reaction, viral or bacterial infection, heat or cold exposure.2. Visit your nearest physician to check with his blood glucose level [low blood sugar level causing hunger, thirsty, light headdress, sweating] and for EKG [electrocardiograph] to exclude any heart abnormality.3. After necessary examination he may ask for:. Blood culture for malaria. Sputum culture. Urine culture. X-ray of the chests. Since chills are natural response of body to variety of conditions thus prior to opting for any medication kindly visit your health care doctor.

input: I was bitten two days ago by a fire ant, three times on my middle toe on my left foot. It became inflamed and red very quickly. I used benadryl, it stopped the itching. Yesterday morning the swelling had spread to all 4 small toes and into my foot. My doctor prescribed prednisone and topical steroid cream. Also told me to take zyrtec or clariton over the counter. I took the steroid and it seemed to reduce the swelling but by the evening two of the insect bites were black and the surrounding area was also black and swollen. I soaked my foot in epsome salts that helped the pain and reduced the redness and swelling some. Today the bites are still very black and swollen but not exceptionally painful. Should I be concerned? Should I lance them and soak again?
output: Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best not to puncture them because they can introduce infection if the technique is not sterile. You may want to add anti-inflammatory painkillers to your current regimen. They would help with pain relief and also reduce the inflammation due to the bites. Examples are ibuprofen, naproxen should continue your other medication and can also the foot baths. It is possible that the bites may become infected so if there is no improvement you may need a course of antibiotics. I hope this helps

input: My neurologist told me that my brain MRI indicated I have significatly more white matter than someone my age. I had the imaging done to try to find out why I was having chronic sharp pains in my head. I had an ANA panel done along with an MRA and an MRI for my neck. Nothing was discovered concerning the head pain. However, I am now wondering about the excess white matter. He was not concerned about it. The answers I can not find are....Does too much WM mean there is damage? Does it mean there is disease? I plan to schedule a follow up to ask these questions, but in the meantime, I would like to know.
output: Hi, nothing to worry. Excess white matter in brain MRI than usual does not carry significance. Headache is not related to this and various causes for headache like lack of sleep, deny Chat Doctor. No need to follow up.

input: hi i am a 28 yr old male and for the last yr or so I have had a lump right below to my nipple its dry on the surface has kinda mini cracks like a brain and has black spots on its surface. Its about the same size as the nipple but just below on the areola. I have no health insurance to see anyone and dont want to die. Any ideas what possible things this could be.
output: Hi, thanks for query.There is no reason to worry so much. From the appearance it could be either a hair root which has got infected or a cyst. There is nothing to worry, please avoid touching it and do press it. In case of pain or redness you need to see the doctor and take treatment for this. Wishing you good health.

input: I am a 25 year old female, weight 130. Generally I am pretty active(going to the gym at 5-7 per week). However, in the last month or so I have been exhausted and sore which made it difficult to work out.  I blamed in on worsening allergies(I live in the northeast) and everyone seemed to have worse allergies this year. However, my "allergies" were not relieved by over the counter medications and perscription nasal spray.  My symptoms have been getting worse and have been present for at least a month and are flu like.  I have had an intermittent fever for at least a week and have chest pain and a cough.  I was seen by the doctor yesterday and she ran a lyme disease test and a CBC, I had a fever but my ears, throat and nose looked good and my lungs were clear.  I have no relief for my cough, but advil does relieve some of my chest pain.
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Fever with runny nose and soreness could be due to rhinitis (allergic or infective), sinusitis,common cold or may be URI. Runny nose is mostly due to viral infection because of our low immunity. You may need to do complete hologram, ESR,electrolytes and X-ray of face to check for sinusitis. You must go to ENT specialist to get properly diagnosed first as there is fever and cough. So, better to consult doctor.

My mom is 67 years old history of hypothyroid x20 years in September 2014 she became hyperthyroid, change in medication she noticed a change in her handwriting 1 week later loss of right thumb 1 week later right wrist drop digits 2,3, 4 start to appear clawed hyper reflexes right upper extremity all the above changes seemed to happen quickly over 3 weeks thyroid meds are supposively balanced she has seen a neurologist, orthopedist & now wait to have an MRI of her brain MRI C-spine clear
output: Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. It seems a progressive neurologic deficit. It might be temporary and the situation turning back normal. But meanwhile, with a negative spinal MRI, the next step should be cerebral MRI. Thyroid should not be responsible for these symptoms Hope this helps. Please feel free using MHC again

input: Hello, I am 35 yrs old female, I m having hard time to get going, I feel tingles in my face, my both hands, arms and my back. Also having squeeze in chest area, mainly where heterial hernia. also feels dry mouth requires drinking lot fluids. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms could be related to an electrolyte imbalance, diabetes or any other metabolic disorder. That is why I would recommend consulting with your GP for a physical exam and some tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, iron levels, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, vitamin D levels). You should discuss with your doctor on these tests. Meanwhile, I recommend taking plenty of fluids. Kind regards, 

input: hi i have taken 4 ipills from 2nd june onwards till 2nd july and inbetween i got my periods but again i got them on 6th july which was only spotting till the 8th july and then the normal flow started and till now i have spotting ...my gynac gave me etosys mf and celin for 5 days 3 times a day to stop but its increasing my flow and then gives a relief for some time so what is this ?? and she asked to get a beta ChatDoctor test done for what reason ? im scared i hope its not aids or cancer ...
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query.Aids and cancers are the last thing to think of. There are many causes of such difficulties and most of them are benign and treatable. You should check your hormonal levels and do ultrasound of uterus and pelvis to see is there cyst or endometrial pathology. Also, you should check your coagulation factors. Usually such bleeding scan be regulated dwith hormonal therapy, so I am sure it will be possible in your case too. Wish you good health. Regards

input: Hi I have a small bump on my stomach, kind of looks like what a mosquito bite would look like, but it does not itch. I had it for one day a week ago, and than it disappeared and reappeared today. When I touch it I felt the urge to use the bathroom, what could it be?
output: Hi, Dear,Good evening. Thanks for your query to my virtual Chat Doctor Clinic. I studied your query in-depth. In My opinion-diagnosis is-Bed-bug bite / or-spider bite/or insect bite.-Urge to bathroom, may be just coincidental to its touching and I don't feel any relation is there. Still I would advise taking ER Surgeons opinion, who would treat it appropriately. Hope this would resolve your worrying query. Wellcome for more query from you. Good day.

input: how long does an i-pill take action, say i had sex with my wife on thursday the 23th of may, will the pill still be effective if we had unprotected sex after four days from the date of consumption of the first pill, if not then for how many days does the pill takes its action?
output: Hi, I have gone through your question. I pill, or the emergency contraceptive pill has its action in preventing only that pregnancy which can occur by the last intercourse episode. It does not have contraceptive effect for the next unprotected intercourse. You need to take a repeat course of I pill for this act. I would suggest you to use regular contraception, as repeated I pill intake have side effects and have increased failure rate. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health.

output: Hi, A common cause of sleeplessness in a healthy 3-year-old is mostly due to frequent nap in the noon or in the evening. They also have the fear that they will be left alone at night, in that scenario either of the parents should be with the child, till they go into deep sleep.  I would suggest you make the child play well in the evening and lessen the duration of sleep in the noon and avoid caffeinated Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query.

I am on thyroid meds for Graves Disease which was treated with radioactive iodine in 2011. I also have a low immune system (low igg antibody) and have frequent infections. Should I be concerned with my new tingling sensation in my fingers and feet.
output: Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. Tingling in the extremities are a common feature and usually temporary and benign. Still, since you have a rich medical history I recommend you to schedule a Neurological consult and an electromyography plus a nerve conduction study to better evaluate if the tingling is a serious feature. Basically you should not worry because it is very common but still you should consider a neurological consult. Hope this helps Wish you the best health

output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Thickening of blood and development of acne are most probably unrelated to eacChatDoctorplete blood counts and red cell parameters are required to look for polycythemia. Polycythemia is characterized by raised red blood cells and high hemoglobin. Acne need to be managed conservatively with antibiotics and sufficient time should be given to allow the acne to heal.

input: Hi, I have been experiencing back problems for several months. It started after i got back from Drum corps which is marching band across the country fro 2 months. We have to hold our bodies differently then normal, I heard that it is common for back problems. Today it was the worst its ever been. I couldn t stand up for an hour.
output: Yes it is common .and is because of constant stretch of lower back muscles. That we call as lumbar muscle strain. It will slowly resolve .you need to avoid further injury to back muscle by not doing any activity that aggregates your pain. Consult a physiotherapist for low back exercises. You can use lumbar belt that will help in pain control and will prevent further spasm and injury. If pain is severe, causing problems with your day-to-day activities then you can take some painkillers with muscle relaxant in supervision with an orthopedic surgeon.

input: I am getting loose motions with abdominal pain, please help me
output: Hello Gurkha;welcome to Chat Doctor Loose motions with pain in abdomen can be due to infection of the intestines. If you are not pregnant and if you are not allergic to any of the medicines then you can take tablet-Oflox-TZ 1 tablet 2 times a day for 3 days which is a combination of Ofloxacin and Tinidazole both antibacterial and antiprotozoal.

input: The vein over my left temple is pulsating.  No pain, but slight pressure on the edge of my left ocular cavity.  I have a history of panic attacks, and this occurs during them, but at the moment, I am not having an attack.  Could this be something other than stress?
output: Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. It is not a vein but an artery, more specifically, the superficial temporal artery which pulsates. It is a branch of the external carotid artery. Furthermore, it occurs in anxiety disorders. Pulses can be abnormally strong when the patient has an elevated pulse pressure.  This would result in a strong, bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation. Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow. Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism, Severe anemia, Beri Berg (thiamine deficiency), Arterio-venous fistula (e.g. Pages disease or hepatic failure). The most rapidly rising bounding pulse is found in AR(aortic regurgitation), PDA(patent ducts arterioles), coaptation of aorta. Regards

Small bumps on my top of head are hurting. Thers someht
output: Hello, The stress in the work place is itself the cause of the blood pressure and pulse being on the higher side, as any form of stress would increase the stress hormones like a Chat Doctor.  The headache in turn is because of higher blood pressure.  The best way out is some relaxation techniques, sort out the reason of stress and things should be back to normal. Regards 

input: On my way home from the gym for the past three nights I have had a horrible pain in my right side of my mouth, my teeth, upper and lower and my jaw and gums. I just went to the dentist today assuming I had a cracked tooth; and I do not. He thinks I may clench my teeth. I don t know why this is happening now and never before. It lasts about 15 minutes

output: Hello, Your symptoms could be related to gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and a routine check-up: - a resting ECG-complete blood count-blood electrolytes.  An exercise cardiac stress test would help to definitely exclude any possible cardiac issues. In the meantime, I recommend trying an antacid or PPI (omeprazole), before sleep.

input: I recently was horseback riding and the horse got too close to a tree. My leg got too close to the tree and banged it pretty hard. There is a bruise around where my leg was impacted, but the area (its slightly raised) where it scraped/hit has very little feeling in it if I lightly touch it. I have two questions: What should I do to keep doing the aching/hurting and should I be concerned about the numbness?
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! You should know that the numbness in your leg could be related to a pinched or damaged nerve in this area, probably caused by the trauma. Coming to this point, I would recommend taking ibuprofen for the pain. If the numbness persists, I recommend performing a nerve conduction study. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, 

input: What are the first steps to getting help with my mum who has dementia and I am not coping and her GP was completely unhelpful and offering no help at all. I am 60 and have a business to run and I cant sleep. First port of call for practical help please.
output: Hi, I can understand what you might be going through. You haven't mentioned whether your mother is on any treatment as of now and what are the exact symptoms she is suffering from as of now. I would advise you to consult a neurologist first. Thorough evaluation with blood investigations, cardiac evaluation and brain scanning would be needed to determine any primary cause of dementia. She would need treatment with medicines like donepezil which will slow down her progressive cognitive decline. In addition, if she is having any behavioral symptoms, medications might be required for that too. She could also be helped by certain behavioral measures for her memory symptoms. You can discuss this with the neurologist. Hope this information was useful. Best wishes.

I would advise you to consult ER Surgeon for opinion on left lower abdomen lump and ER Gone/Oust Doctor and ER Psychiatrist if your doctors advise you so.Don't worry and things will be right after this check up. Your doctors would rule out pregnancy and would take all due care to investigate and treat it accordingly. Hope this would help your query to satisfaction.

input: Hello sir,  i m 21 yrs old and want to ask you that after urination white droplets come out from my penis, sometimes sticky, and certain times liquid. Why is that happenning so? Is that owing to the seminal vesicles as they have become filled with semen or anything other?
output: Hello White Chat Doctor. It is a common condition, and may be due to inadequate emptying, straining,overexcited state etc. You may need to evaluate for constipation. You may also be advised to release semen intermittently. This is not a serious finding, you will be fine soon. Get well soon. Take Care

output: Hello, Certainly it needs treatment. It can damage heart and lungs permanently and there wouldn't be any treatment for that. So you should get it treated. Treatment depends upon the location and other characters of the hole, whether surgery is needed or device closure can be done. So you discuss with cardiologist regarding the option of device closure which is minor procedure. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: My daughter is 16 weeks old. A red rash has appeared under her neck and chest where they meet, and in the creases of her arms and behind knees. Could this be heat rash or a milk rash. It has been lingering for 5 days. I have been giving her oatmeal baths twice a day and putting baby oil gel on her when she gets out and blotting her dry. This seems to be only a temporary solution.
output: Hello. I just read through your question. What you describe is consistent with a heat rash. The oatmeal baths help. Moisturizing after the bath will help as well. It may take several more days, but the rash will resolve.

If you can give the contact number of doctors who are specialized in liddle s syndrome. Is there any special doctor for the syndrome (like pediatrcian for children.....). Thanks

input: Hi I don t know but there is like a red area towards the bottom of my penis and it doesn t itch or burn or anything it s just red I wonder what would have caused it could it be to much masterbating or irritation from something what is causing it to be red around the bottom of my penis
output: HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor Redness around penis can be due to multiple reason, but in your case it may be due to any infection because of sweating or external trauma because of masturbation. Just clean this area regularly and keep Chat Doctor.  Change your undergarment regularly. In case, it causes itching or burning, then consult a dermatologist for proper evaluation. Thanks

input: Hi, i recently had a deep dental cleaning and cannot open my mouth more than an inch. painful and it s like it s locked and i cannot eat food either. only liquids. doctor had to give me high doses of shots b/c novacain doesn t take effect. Dentist perscribed me an anti biotic and predisone and said I got acid in my muscle tissues in my mouth which apparently isn t uncommon. he said it could takes weeks before i can open my mouth. i ve never heard of anything like this before. any suggestions? YYYY@YYYY Thank you!
output: Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query. The limited or difficulty in mouth opening can be because of the trauma to the muscles while injecting local anesthesia or repeated injections, or it can be a disc displacement in the jaw joint that occurs if you had kept your mouth opened for long time during cleaning. Nothing to be panic, you can take analgesics like ibuprofen and muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. Give hot fomentation over the joint and muscles. I hope my answer will help you. Take care

input: I am a 31 year old female. I am over all very healthy. For the past week, I have had a very bad cough, but no other symptom. No runny nose, sore throat...nothing. The cough is a very deep and dry cough. I have also been feeling heaviness in my chest. Yesterday, I noticed that my body began aching. Today, my body has been aching all day. I went to urgent care, they didnt do an xray, and diognosed me with bronchitis. They gave me an anitibiotic, but im concerned because, I just dont feel like myself, and I think its something more. I should also mention that I am a smoker, and I smoke about 4-6 cigarettes a day!
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are a active smoker, possibility of bronchitis is more for your symptoms. And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

output: Hello, Cause of eosinophilic may be idiopathic, allergic, hay fever, Chat Doctor. Treatment of eosinophilic is aimed at cause of eosinophilic. As you have mentioned you have pain in sole your eosinophilic may be due to parasitic infection. Stool examination may be red to rule out parasitic infection. If it is due to parasitic infection it can be treated by antiworm medicines.

input: Hi, I m a 30 year old female and on January 9 th I had emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis of the cecum . They removed my cecum, ileocecal valve , and appendix, luckily I do not have a colostomy they were able to reconnect everything without any problems. I did have a general surgeon who actually specializes in vascular surgery do the procedure because he was on call. I have been experiencing some difficulty sleeping since surgery. I will doze off and wake up feeling nauseated and lightheaded with a weird vibratory sensation throughout my chest. Also when I stand up my vision goes dark for a few seconds. I am eating 4-5 small meals a day and drinking one Gatorade and about 2 bottled water a day. My urine is light yellow and I am going about 5-6 times a day. BM s daily to every other day, no diarrhea. I haven t been taking any pain meds since I left the hospital on the 12 th. I take Zantac and Prevacid once daily. It may just be anxiety from the whole experience but I m just a little concerned. Thanks for any advice.
output: Hi. I don't think it is related to surgery complication. It is procedure which can be well done by every general surgeon. It is always expected to feel some nonspecific gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea or stomach cramps but symptoms you're saying don't seem to be serious. If you have fever associated with abdominal pain OE extensive vomiting then you should go to hospital.  For other, I suggest just to wait few more weeks. It is not so much time from surgical procedure so just be wait a bit more to see are these symptoms gonna persist. Wish you good health.

input: Hi, I ve had an under the surface lump in my neck for about 7 years now. I went to a doctor when it first appeared and he told me not to worry about it unless it got bigger, then to go back to a doctor to get tests done. So, I just figured since he didn t think it was anything to worry about it wouldn t be anything.. Anyways, I m 20 now and it has grown a significant amount since i ve seen that doctor but I didn t think anything of it until now. It s been hurting on and off for a few months now and sometimes feels like it s blocking my ability to breathe. I ve also started getting a spotanteous, tense pain the in the base of my skull at the back of my neck. As well, If I star at something for a while the object starts to shake. I ve also had a bruise on my shin for about 4 years now that just wont go away. I m not sure if any of these things are connected but if you could help me with any or all of these issues I would greatly appreciate it. I m not the type of person who really likes to go to the doctor as I feel like i m just wasteing their time.. But these things are really starting to worry me and I don t want to be worrying over nothing. Thank you so so much. Samantha
output: Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor now, preferably a general surgeon or an ENT doctor. Medical and physical examination will be done. Diagnostics (neck ultrasound or ct-scan and a biopsy) will be requested if the lesion needs further investigation. Management (medical or surgical if indications are found) will be done accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.

input: 26 yo female - 5 6 145lbs. I recently missed the bottom 2 stairs and fractured my ankle. I have been to the DR recently for an annual physical. All bloodwork/labs show normal including thyroid and hormones. The night I fell and fractured my ankle, about 5 min after the fall I got extremely hot, started sweating, and got light headed. I felt like I was going to pass out. I lost hearing except for a high pitch ringing noise. This lasted a minute or two. This was by far the most extreme version of this happening, but I have had this happen several time before. What could be the cause of my cold sweats, light headedness, and muffled hearing???
output: Hello, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to low blood pressure, probably caused by a physiological reaction to the pain and trauma. In my opinion, there is nothing concerning in this situation, considering the trauma you have gone through. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing you good health. 

input: Im in the hospital.  2nd case of ischemic colitis in 7 months.  Ive had 2 previous heart attacks and a moderate aortic leak.  I understand the ischemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon.  What causes the lack of blood flow?  No doctor can answer that yet.
output: Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards.

input: I went to the dentist a few months ago to get a retainer (the clear plastic one) and it creates big ulcers so bad that i cant put it back in. So after a few month i went back and hes letting me try again, but the ulcer has come back in the exact same spot. Is this because of the retainer?
output: Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor I have gone through your query, as you are wearing retainer and ulcer develops on same point again, yes ulcer can be due to retainer may be due to sharp edges or any sharp point on retainer causing ulcer.  Don't worry you go to dentist and get trimming of that sharp point or edge are there.  You can apply ointment McCoppin or Pans oral on ulcer twice daily for healing.  Take one capsule vitamin B complex once daily for 7 days. Hope this will help you. Wishing you good health.

It was improving when I saw my Dr. then it came back, 2 different times.

input: I recently had protected sex with a female and have developed a itchy red and bumpy rash on my penis since. She did sit down on me when I had no condom on but no penetration occurred. The rash appeared that night and has gotten slightly worse but has not progressed anywhere else past my penis and scrotum until today when it seems like I have the same red bumps on my tongue that were not there before. My tongue feels sore almost like it is raw in certain spots and I have had a sore throat after giving her oral. I also have a considerable amount of plaque build up on my tongue if that s related at all.On a side note I had lamisil ultra in my medicine cabinet and the rash seems to be going away slightly from the cream. So my question is this something to worry about or is it just something fungal that should clear up on it s own?
output: Hi, It could very well be only a fungal infection. But, I would advise you to see your Dermatologist or GP who can examine you and advice you to get screened for STDs and I would advise you to start medicines for STDs. It would definitely be better to be safe than suffer the consequences if it is STD. So please your GP or Skin Specialist and let them decide. Take care, Chat Doctor. 

input: For the past 3 weeks Ive been suffering with ongoing severe derealization and I cant shake it. I wanted to know if their are any medicines that can help with this and how long does it take for them to work? I had a severe attack like this 2 1/2 years ago and was put on wellbutrin for it and the derealization went away after about 5 to 6 weeks. I went to the doctor this past tuesday and she put me on citalopram and metoporol and she said it should work much faster than wellbutrin but it hasnt worked so far and its been 4 days.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Derealization disorder is not a stand-alone disorder but dissociative symptoms of many conditions, in psychiatry and neurotic spectrum. It is also called Depersonalization-derealization disorder. Psychological counseling helps you understand why depersonalization and derealization occur, and helps you gain control over the symptoms so that they go away. Two such techniques include cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Depersonalization-derealization disorder may also improve when counseling helps with other mental health conditions, such as depression.

I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: Hello, I was contacted by a condo building I am staying at for vacation. They told me there had been two cases of legionnares disease in the last thirteen months  I am taking my six year old grandson is there a risk? They said the werent sure if the disease was from the condos. Thank you, Tammy
output: There is a small risk, otherwise they wouldn't have mentioned it at all. Since its only been 2 cases over 13 months, and they're not even sure it's the condos, the risk is probably very, very small but not zero. You will need to decide if even a tiny risk is too great for your comfort. You and your grandson will probably be okay, but since a source has not been identified and eliminated, it might still be possible to contract the disease. Hope this answers your question.

input: Dr. i have been married 4 months before and having sex regularly. we both of us same blood group is A+ does the same blood group affect the pregnancy. or whats a good time of sex for pregnancy. Please suggest Dr. We are not doing sex in a monthly period time of MINE for 4 days. please guide us.
output: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Fertile period in a cycle of 28 day duration is from 10th day to 18th day. Usually ovulation happens 14 days prior to your next cycle. So difficult to predict exact day of ovulation. If you have regular cycle plan to have intercourse around day of ovulation. Your cervical mucous changes during your fertile period becoming more slippery, wet and clear - its often described as having the look and feel of uncooked egg whites - indicating ovulation. Few tips to increase conception rates:Avoiding additional lubricants during sex. Choosing a sexual position that encourages deep penetration. Leaving the penis in the vagina until it goes soft after ejaculation. After sex, you can increase your chances of conception by lying flat for half an hour after sex. Being in the healthy weight range optimize conception, your partner should ideally avoid ejaculation for 2 -3 days before your fertile period to increase his sperm count.  Hope this helps you.

output: HIIT seems your child has VIRAL diarrhea following a respiratory illness. It's common at this age. Green poops are due to reduced transit time of gut in diarrhea. I would recommend an ORS properly constituted, probiotic (Eco norm or sporadic) and a zinc supplement for treatment. There is no need for antibiotics.they may sometimes aggravate the problem. Antibiotics needed only if blood or mucous on stool examination present.

input: hi i was wondering what does this result mean? the heart is in hyperdynamic state the left ventricle has moderate concentric hypertrophy. The LVEF is around 80%. The inferior wall looks hypokinetic. There is evidence of early reversal of E/A ratio. The cusps of the aortic valves are slightly bulky. The AV V max is 1.70 m/sec. There is trivial turbulence in the aortic valves. There is trivial pulmonic and trivial tricuspid insufficiency. The TRP is not raised. Both IAS and IVS look intact. There is no thrombus or vegetation. There is o.75cm pericardial effusion behind RV and at the apex of the heart.
output: Hi, This is an echo report & not an ECG report. This report broadly means that you might be having hypertension which is causing pressure on heart & causing thickening of a chamber of heart (LVH). It is also telling that one side of heart is working less than other parts(hypokinetic inferior wall), which may be because of blockage of one of the arteries of heart. Rest everything is fine. Heart pumping capacity is good(LVEF-80%). So you need further evaluation for that inferior wall hypokinesis. Thanks Chat Doctor. 

input: My 3.5 year old son had his first bite of shrimp. Some swelling and pimple like blotches have appeared on the corner of his cheek/mouth. Can this wait to see a doctor in the morning. He is not complaining or saying it bothers him at all. What should I watch for?
output: I would be concerned of an allergic reaction to shrimp, given the swelling around the mouth and blotchy skin. I would not wait to see a doctor in the morning, because allergic reactions can proceed quickly and become life-threatening. You should watch for if he should begin to have any signs of difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue or lips, and spreading of the rash. If any of these occur, seek emergent medical attention right away.

output: Hello are 60 years old with DES after heart attack. Now you are also having cough, with thick mucus for one month, these symptoms may be due to these possibilities, these include:1 Bronchiectasis, diagnosis can be confirmed by sputum for culture and X-ray chest .2 Lung abscess .3 Tuberculosis .4 Asthmatic allergic bronchitis. Patient usually feels whistling sound with wheezing. Thick mucus may be due to post nasal discharge. In my opinion consult a primary care physician and get his opinion. Usually I advise my patient to take montelukast= albuterol, one tablet one in a day (in few cases twice in a day). Codeine +chlorampheniramine male ate cough syrup. Since these are prescription Chat Doctor. Good luck.

output: Hi, In the current scenario, you would need a pelvic examination and a trans-vaginal sonogram to know the exact cause. Pelvic causes like pelvic inflammation and endometriosis should be considered. An urinalysis also should be performed to exclude any associated infection. Endometriosis can also give such a picture of sticky bleeding. Pregnancy is not likely with such symptoms. A pelvic antibiotic and hormonal treatment should alleviate the symptoms. Metonymic acid and dicyclomine can be taken to relieve the pain. Hope this helps.

input: Hi, I am 24 year old male working for a software company in Bangalore. I am working for the past one year. I had a severe back pain and also severe pain in the neck which made me to see an orthopedician. I was given some painkillers and some exercise tips to continue. I followed it for some time and could not find much improvement after stopping the painkillers. I went back to the doctor again for a better advice. He suspected something peculiar now and referred me to a pain and rehabilitation clinic. I got the diagnosis there. Do you know what it is a Computer related Injury (CRI)? This is the exact diagnosis made. After I came out of his office and walked through the road thinking what peculiar diseases are coined depending on the occupation we say and googled it next day, I was astonished to hundreds of pages opened up with this condition called Computer related Injuries.The CRI research was on for the more than 25years though the IT revolution has come up in late nineties in India.

When the symptoms started I had an EKG, stress test and stress echo. These have all been normal. I even had a heart cath, which showed a 30% narrowing of my anterior desending coronary artery and a couple of lesser narrowings in two other vessels. I take paxil (20mg) a day for depression. I have taken this for over 10 years. My job is often stressfull, but I am an even keeled non flustered individual. Everytime I go to the doctor things check out normal. I am beginning to fill like I m going crazy and am becomming increasings concerned.
output: I understand your symptoms have been troubling you now and then, but we need to know the age, what brings the relief and what your habits are. Usually your pattern symptoms arise due to heart or/and lungs being diseased, but you have reports of normalcy in EKG and Stress tests with good perfusion of heart at the beginning.

input: I was wondering, I have just noticed a lump on my temple starting. It s a not big maybe the size of a finger tip. It hurts to touch but doesn t give me a headache. When I bite down it hurts aswell. I do a lot of strenuous work but I m not sure if that would have anything to do with it or if I should see a doctor?
output: Hello! Thank you for the query. This lump is most likely a local skin infection. It may be caused by hair follicle inflammation, sebaceous cyst or any other skin problem. It has nothing to do with your work. As it is painful, pus is most likely inside. That is why I suggest you to consult general surgeon with this issue. The lump should be incised, Chat Doctor.

input: Hi my 1yr old daugher has been having fever and cough for sometime now, her wgt is 12kgs and the blood test came up with 19000 WBC. THe doctor has prescribed Cepodem 5ml once a day. BUt has been vomiting after that and her coughing has increased. Is it safe to give her that.
output: Hi...by what you quote I feel that she is having a viral illness, and it is common for cough to get aggravated while recovering form viral illness. I do not think Code - an antibiotic-is indicated for a count of 19000. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out lung diseases like bronchitis or asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis or asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

output: Hello! I understand your concern. In my opinion your troubles are probably due to a cervical disc problem. It may be dislocated, or it may be just degenerative changes to your cervical vertebral column. These changes explain the back pain, headaches, dizziness.  Also, the changes in your cervical x-ray can be explained by this diagnosis. I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is. In the meantime you can use acetaminophen, ibuprofen or fetoprotein for the pain and avoid abrupt cervical movements. A cervical collar can help. Hope to have been helpful. Thank you for using Chat Doctor. Best wishes.  Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi Dr. Stephen, i just took my daughter to see the dentist and she wasn t sure if my daughter has gum infection or fungus. Then we took her to her doctor. She said my daughter has gum infection an prescribed her antibiotic . Now she doesnt have fever , but it seems like the infection is spreading out and getting worse. Im thinking taking her to the emergency room. So can you give me an advise? tks a lot.
output: Hello there, poor oral hygiene and deficiency of vitamin C can cause gum inflammation at young age. It shows symptoms like redness, swelling and bleeding of gums. Viral and bacterial infection worsen the condition. At home, you can ask your daughter to rinse her mouth regularly with warm saline water, antiseptics like Betadine, chlorexidine etc. that gives soothing effect. See your dentist soon. Thorough professional ultrasonic cleaning of gums and root planing followed by a course of medicines will solve her problem. I hope that helps you, take care.

output: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms may be related to anxiety or autonomic dysfunction related to nightmares. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a careful physical examination and some tests:-resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound-chest X-ray study-blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, etc.) to exclude other causes of increased heart rate. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would be necessary to examine your heart rhythm trends during day and night and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. You should discuss on the above issues with your attending physician. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best regards!

input: Hello, about a year ago, I bit a small part of my upper lip. It usually shouldnt be a problem because it heals and closes, but in my case its not doing that. Every 3-4 days, a new layer of skin forms, and starts pealing, and eventually peels off completely. After another 3-4 days a new skin layer forms again, then start peeling, and goes away completely also. This has been going on for 1 year, there is no bleeding associated with it, but this wound just won`t heal and close, and a new skin layer forms and peals every 3-4 days. I tried using every medical lip stick I know off and all sort of things but they are not working. What is the solution?

It could be due to riboflavin deficiency as well. I would suggest you to :-- Maintain proper oral hygiene.- Do HY Chat Doctor.  Mix HY

Can a doctor remove the the lipoma and do rotator cuff repair at one time? Any suggestions of doctors in Phoenix az?

input: Hi Dr Age: 36 Gender: Male Constant feeling of urination after abusive, lengthy masturbation and persistent mild burning in male urethea. Any nerve/tissue damage? I am having a sensation of constant/always urination; with a weired kind of burning senation in peline urethera and penile head. This situtation occurs after i did abusive/lengthy masturbation 10 MONTHS ago. After masterbation or having intercource with my wife it used to come for only 2 - 3 hours and after sleep in the morning used to feel alright. But due to a lenghty/abusing masterbation session 10 MONTHS ago feeling of urination have become constant and not going away The following test are done so far. 1. Urine Culture - All Normal. 2. Renal Ultrasound - All Normal (prostate size is normal about 24) 3. CBC - All Nomral. (Dr Says very slight Iron Deficiency Anemia; dr put me on iron tablets for a month) 4. LFT - All Normal. 5. Diabetic - Normal 5. Vitamin D - I am deficient (Dr put me on tablets for a month) 6. Vitamin B - Before the onset of these symptoms i was deficient in vtamin B and had few injections of cynacoblamin were given. All the doctors are clue less as of now; these symptoms are really really killing me everyday. I have seen a few urologists with the following diagnosis and treatment but with no relief. 1. A urologist diagnosed it as non-specific non-inflammatory prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 4 weeks but to no avail after that he put me on levofloxacin for a week with no relief at all. 2. Another urologist marked it as NSU and put me on numbing jell and a tablet which turns your urine dark yellow for 5 days with no avail. I also took a TCA Tofranil (Imipramine) for about 2 weeks for no avail at all. After being exhaused from thease treatments i have also tried alternative treatments as follows. 1. Homeopathic for 2 months with no avail. 2. TCM (Traditional chinese medicines for few months with no avail) As I am running out of ideas may be the following can be considered. 1. parasitic infection. 2. Pudendal nerve entrpement or perinal nerve pinching etc. Dorsal nerve etc. Or any other nerve disorder. 3. IC 4. MS Please help me to get rid of these annoying symptoms.
output: HelloThanks for query. Based on the facts that you have narrated you have a long-standing history of pain in urethra and constant sensation to pass urine which followed after prolonged abusive masturbation which has not responded to treatment with multiple antibiotics and none of the various relevant test are conclusive as regards the diagnosis and cause of your symptoms. In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra. I would suggest you to consult your urologist again and explore need for doing endoscopic examination of urethral passage (Ureteroscopy). This procedure of visualization of urethral passage directly perhaps may help to diagnose the precise cause for your symptoms. Further treatment will be decided by him on final diagnosis. There is no possibility of pinching of any nerve as it never happens in reality. Chat Doctor. 

input: There is a hard lump behind my 5 month old baby s ear. It has been there for 3 or 4 months. The doctor didn t say much about it and didn t seem to worry; however, it is still there.

Hope the query is answered, thanks

input: I have been diagnosed yet again with another UTI with Klebsiella being the bug that is always found in my urine. The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me
output: Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly, Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hello doctor. I have been havin a toothache since few days. I ws told few months back that the tooth needed a root canal. A temporary coverin ws done but within days it came off and exposed tooth since then. I ws advised meftal - forte tablets to take for pain by a chemist. Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you!
output: Hello, I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed, and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth. I usually recommend taking a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol to control a more severe pain until you are able to visit the dentist again. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will feel relief soon.

input: Our daughter is 26 months and we gave her 2.5ml of Emeset 2mg/5ml today afternoon and evening on prescription. She vomited immediately in the evening and we have given her another dose.

output: Hi, The rash may be due to a variety of causes and could be related to the surgery done. You could take antihistamine tablets for symptomatic relief. But the ideal option is to visit your operating surgeon and to notify about the rash. He would refer you to a Dermatologist if necessary. Hope I have answered your query.

I understand you are worried, but I would suggest you to calm down and follow these step sim explaining below:It's obvious you have done a muscular straining and probably spinal ligaments straining since you have done an acrobatic movement that has passed your limits. So first I would suggest you to use:- Fetoprotein gel to your affected area of your back to kill the pain and inflammation- Oral painkillers such as ibuprofen of diclofenac if you have severe pain.- Cold compresses first and Warm compresses if more than one day have passed from the injury. Try to reduce the movements of your back and lumbar area for a while of time. If you perform these steps and still you have not any improvement then consult an orthopedist to do further examinations. I hope you will get relief soon. Take care and I wish all the best! Chat Doctor.

If this symptom has occurred for the first time and doesn't repeat any more there is nothing to worry about. If spot is going to happen again you have to make an appointment with your gynecologist.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. 

input: My 17 yo nephew has admitted to drinking a couple gulps of my Paul Mitchell liquid hairspray after I smelled the distinctive watermelon scent. His aim was to get high (obviously before I strangle him) he claims he indeed buzzed and feels like he has sever heartburn. What to do? Thank you!
output: He is having gastroesophageal reflux disease HERD. I would advise him to take Tab Pan 40 and syrup Genus 1 SF three times a day for 10 days. This will relieve the symptom. Get a physician opinion as well.

input: My son was given benztropine 2mg for bipolar and for hallucinating he was also given olanzapane 5 mg. My issue is the benztropine 2mg that is for treating Parkinson s, why was he prescribed something for muscle spasm and other things that doesn t pertain to his condition? I m sure I must be missing something, I m not a doctor......lol Please help!

input: Ok. I feel silly asking but my left armpit feels a little achy and if you follow around the arm up the front to the top of my breast (near the shoulder ) that area is a little achy and feels just lumpy and puffy. I should also tell that I pick up my 21 month old granddaughter and primarily carry her using the same arm (left side). The pain isn t severe or anything; mostly annoying and now that I m thinking about it (and concerned of cancer of course) I m much more aware of it. I ve had it for several weeks. What do you think?
output: Hi cat dog, The ache which you must be a muscular pain due to sprain or strain. Must get settled with shoulder rest, physiotherapy and analgesics. Since you already have a 21-month-old granddaughter it is time for you to have a mammogram and ultrasound done to screen for any cancer in breast in both sides. All the best.  

input: My boyfriends blood sugar on a good day is normally between 70-80. Sometimes after eating a large meal or one high in carbs it will spike up to 100 or more. He becomes very disoriented ,lightheaded, slurs his words and is very shakey. Sometimes it takes a few hours to get back to his NORMAL in the 70s. His doctors say that he isnt diabetic. They never see the spike and wont listen to him. What do you think the problem could be and what should we do to make them listen. He is a former combat medic and EMT. His doctors are at the VA clinic and they instantly discount him because it is always so low when he goes in for a check up.
output: Hi, As you have mentioned Blood sugar levels of your boyfriend, all Blood sugar level reading are normal, there is no evidence of diabetes. For diagnosis of diabetes one of the following criteria need to be fulfilled 1) Oral glucose tolerance test Fasting Blood sugar level more than 125 and/or 2 hours post glucose blood sugar level more than 200. 2) HbA1c level more than 6.5. 3) Symptomatic for diabetes i.e. increased frequency of urination, unusual thirst, unusual hunger, weight loss, along with this random blood sugar levels more than 200. Whatever symptoms mentioned by you like disorientation, slurred speech, abnormal shakiness, light headiness do not denote Diabetes. Taking in to consideration of profession of your boyfriend it looks like a possibility of anxiety. Better to consult another doctor during period of symptoms, or you can make video during symptomatic period.

input: Hi...yes, thanks.  I have been having loose stool of varying color for about 3 months now. No regular stool passing during this time.  It is sometimes coincides with mild stomache aches, but not often.  I eat pretty healthy,  This has coincided with a sustained period of stress at work and Im wondering if this could be stress related, an ulcer, or something along those lines.  Any thoughs?  Thanks Michael
output: Hi, Looking to the history it seems that this problem might be due to stress called spurious diarrhea. As you got this problem since long, another cause might be having chronic gastrointestinal infection, bacterial or protozoal. Avoid stress. Go for one course of ofloxacilin, tinidazole combination medicine course for 5 days. Avoid junk food. Ok and take care.

I am puzzled because I ve been measuring my blood sugar levels and they seem to be in the normal range. 95-98 in the am, 105- 110 within a half hr. to an hr. after eating.

input: Hi, I m a female aged 29. About 6 weeks ago I got a really intense pain that comes in waves at the top of my stomach. The pain is so bad and on the same pain scale as contractions, only higher up between my ribs. Within the 6 weeks I ve had this pain on 3 seperate occasions and each time it s been followed by dirrahrea. It usually lasts about 2 days. 4 weeks ago I took a really sharp pain in behind my rib on my right side that went up into my right shoulder. The pain came on me very quickly and I couldn t lie down or take deep breaths as the pain was so bad, I was so worried I went to a&e, on arrival I had a high temp, pulse over 100 and low blood pressure. Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about , I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36, only bloods still showed infection, but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was. I got sent home with stronger anti biotics, I started to feel a bit better within 2 days but I still kept the pain for about 2 weeks after. Since all this I have been to my own GP, she redone my bloods , all came back clear accept my liver ggt which was slightly raised but not raised enough to do anything about. I ve got an US appointment in a couple of weeks, I m really hoping I can get to the bottom of all this, have you any ideas ? Do you think both these symptoms could b related? Any feedback would be gratly appreciated, many thanks!
output: You had episodes of severe pain at lower two ribs at right side probably rt Hyperion Chat Doctor. Your CT thorax was normal, and blood investigation showed infection i.e. raised total count, X-ray was normal. I wonder y abdominal CT wasn't done.  This kind of pain can be due to respiratory, CVS, GIT, ( cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, colitis, diverticulitis, PUD)etc.... pathology. As CT thorax was normal respiratory pathology can be rule out. Blood investigation dint showed any pathology.  As you are going for ultrasound whole abdomen it will show other pathologies. If it shows normal study then you can go for CT Aldo.n last ECG Only after your physicians advise. Thanks n regards 

input: My husband is on a blood thinner (Xarelto), which he took at apx 6:30 this evening. At dinner he bit the inside of his bottom lip and it is STILL bleeding. I have tried the following: Ice with his head back.Chalk stick used for shaving cuts.Rolling his lip down and holding pressure with a Hemosat Foam Strip. (Several times, several minutes)Also rolled lip down and held Hemostat Gauze for few minutes.He recently cut his finger and after hours of bleeding, we used WoundSeal powder recommended by a paramedic and it stopped, but I feel sure I cant use this powder in his mouth. Even if we were careful that he not ingest it, I know it says it needs to stay dry in order to form a scab, so being inside his lip it could not stay dry. Can you suggest ways to stop the bleeding that are safe to use inside his lip? We are trying to avoid a several hour wait in the ER for this! Thank You
output: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The reasons for uncontrolled bleeding is the blood thinners in this case, other reasons are hemophilia. The incidence of previous bleeding is before starting of the Chat Doctor.  I advise you to consult your doctor, for diagnosis, he may reduce the dose of the 

input: Hi, I was working out yesterday (on the rowing machine) and yesterday afternoon, all night and today I am feeling a flutter in my chest. It feels like my heart is palpitating but my husband says maybe I just pulled a chest muscle.  I used the rowing machine the past 2 days in 20 minute increments.  could this have caused a pulled muscle?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because arrhythmia commonly causes palpitations and Fluttering sensations in chest. So consult doctor and get done 1. ECG 2. 2d echo 3. Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Pulled muscle can also be the cause. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: I believe I will need a dentist to answer my question. Is there one available? My son lost two of his bottom teeth over month ago. Yesterday he came to show me his mouth. One of the spaces has bubbled and become dark blue however he is in no pain or discomfort. There is no sign on his perminent tooth . What could this be and how concerned should I be?
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, After reading your history I suspect the lost teeth were primary or milk teeth, you did not mention your sons age so that we can predict the eruption of permanent teeth. I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get an x-ray done for the affected area. x-ray will show if there is a remnant of tooth left in the jaw that has lead to swelling and bluish discoloration or there is some infection or bubbling of the area is due to permanent tooth erupting. Accordingly treatment can be carried out. I hope this helps you, take care.

input: I had sepsis in October 2013. I now have bruising on the soft pallet and petechiae on gums and tongue. Still havent been feeling great, losing weight, chills, fatigue and upset stomachs daily. Should I be worried? Should I see my doctor? They said it would take time to feel better. Finished Ive antibiotic beginning of Dec.
output: Hi, I understand your concern.  Sepsis & also the antibiotics taken to control it disturb the normal intestinal flora which keeps our gastrointestinal tract healthy. To manage, -Keep oral cavity clean by warm water gargles.  - Use a mild paste with finger/slim soft brush. -apply boroglycerine to affected area.  -Take warm/cold milk, non-irritant/bland food, grated juices, salads - B complex (specifically folic acid)& vitamin C supplements are essential.  - Take Lactobacillus preparation before food.  - Avoid constipation. Exclude amoebas. * To consult doctor for assessment of health & prescription of medicines n proper combination.  Thanks.

input: dear sir i am a medical persons my mothers have a upper abdominal pain bodyache and low back pain .on ultrasound report have  simple  liver cyst and rt cortical renal cyst .what cn i do sir please give me an appropriate way for treatment .
output: Hi, These conditions might really not be related and need a keen review. Liver cysts are treated depending on the cause. They could need Chat Doctor.  Upper abdominal pain could be due to gastritis or pancreatitis or some medical or surgical. In case these symptoms have been going on for a long time, the opinion of a gastroenterologist, coupled with an abdominal ultrasound and Ct scan would be helpful to guide diagnosis and treatment. Kind regards

This is the worst- I cannot walk due to not being able to cope with the pain. The pain won t allow me to even bear my own weight. What do you think Lynn
output: Hello, It may be due to some muscle or ligament injury or can be due to symphysis pubis dysfunction. As of now you can take analgesics like Ibuprofen or Diclofenac.

input: My baby is 1yr. old (12months). For last 2 days she is having loose motions. I don t know whether to call it as loose motion but she is having toilet 3-4 times a day. Toilet smells badly. Also colour of toilet is Blackish Green, Yellow and also it is sticky. Please let me know what kind of food shall i give to her. I normally used to feed her milk, Dal/Rice, Fruit(banana/Apple), Khir etc.
output: Hi, Does she have fever or vomiting? Does the stool contain blood or mucus? Is there any abdominal pain or discomfort while pooping? If no above said symptoms, this need not be taken as significant. Some change in stool frequency, colour or consistency is common once in a while, and need not be worried about. You can continue the same feeds as before. If stool is too loose, reducing amount or withholding fruits for few days might help. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: Hello. I kicked something and now my foot is slightly swollen, slightly bruised, but definitely sore. I cannot bend my big toe (which is the area where the pain originates, in the foot part just below my big toe) not because of the pain, but I physically cannot make it bend. It hurts to walk on the affected area but I can walk. I just cannot put weight on the big toe. It is painful with a mixture between dull and achy and suddenly sharp or throbbing. Though, I took a Vicodin and the pain is a lot better. The pain is more localized and the areas around it hurt less allowing me to put weight on those areas. Does this sound more like it could be a sprain since the pain medication helped with almost all of the pain aside from the milder pain I feel in the location of the bruise and swelling?
output: Dear patient You have injured your foot more so your great toe and possibility of fracture cannot be ruled out since pain is not relieved.  I would advise X-ray of involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to confirm diagnosis.  If it shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon with report.  If its normal diagnosis is sprain and recommended treatment is rest for 2 weeks and tab diclofenac 50 mg twice a day for 5 days. All the best.

output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She should go for MRI once.  It will give exact diagnosis.  If it brains cancer then surgery and radiotherapy is the treatment.  If it is some other pathology then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: 18 month old more tired and cranky than usual. Other than the end of a cold, she s healthy. She normally sleeps 11 hours at night, with a 2 hour nap. For the past 2 days, she has slept 12-13 hours at night with an almost 3 hour nap. She s normally quite pleasant, but has recently been cranky and even laying around some when awake. She s asking for milk more...seems hungry. Growth spurt? Other ideas would be appreciated!
output: Hi, thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.Sometimes kids are more hungry and cranky without an apparent reason. But just look for any ear ache or pain while passing urine which can make kids irritable and are usually missed. If she is not having these, then she is in the recovery phase from her cold which has increased her appetite. Just give her an extra meal for another week or so before going to sleep. Hope this has helped you. Your vote of thanks is appreciated, Good luck, Chat Doctor.

For getting pregnant following things are required-in women-regular menses reproductive age group(15-45years)normal reproductive organs(uterus, tubes,ovaries etc.). In man-normal semen analysis(normal sperm count, motility etc.) as u told that u both have all reports normal then DON'T WORRY.RELAX.there is high chances of getting pregnancy in your case.u also told that u had abortion, but DON'T WORRY, it happens with most of the women. It doesn't mean that u can't be pregnant in the future. it's normal.nothing is wrong in this. With the above discussion u can try out my suggestions-1. Try to do coitus during fertile period(it is from 10th to 16th day of menses during this period chances of getting pregnancy is high).2. KEEP PATIENCE...there is high chances in your case. Just RELAX.3. If u r in hurry then visit nearby infertility specialist. He/she can help u. I hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful for u.regards- Chat Doctor. .

input: I ve noticed a small hard lump on the outside of my left upper biceps for several weeks now. The skin over and around the lump are was suddenly darkened with what seemed like some sort of bleeding under the skin. A week ago, a doctor told me it was nothing more that a few tiny ruptured blood vessels from possibly a trauma to the arm and that the large dark stain should clear up in 2 to 3 weeks. Well the dark patch has almost cleared up now but the relatively painless lump remains. The lump can only be felt by running a finger over the area because it is invisible from outside. What do you think please? By the way, I broke my middle finger on the same arm about a year ago and had a lot of numbness and stiffness after POP removal. Although the finger movement remains somewhat stiff, I can t relate it to the biceps lump. Sorry for the long explanation, thank you.
output: Hi Reading your description of the lump and its progressive history- To me, it appears as torn biceps long head at the shoulder joint. It will remain as a lump and become prominent only of flexing your arm. It is painless and harmless and requires no treatment. The discoloration in the skin was due to bleeding in the area which has resorted now.

input: I was recently diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, after going to a neurologist his assistant informed me that it is not a pituitary tumor but it next to it by my brain...The reason I even found out about this is through an MRI I had because of vision issues that I am having (double vision) the thing is this is the third incident it seems to come and go with the first time being in 2009, the second in 2011, both with pregnancies, and now this time while I was on an appetite suppressant. What do you think
output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. If you had double vision, the tumor infiltrated cavernous sinus, and treatment depends on the kind of tumor. In that area three are the most probable lesions: Pituitary tumor, Meningioma and Chraniopharyngioma. If the size of tumor is small (below 3 cm) it could be treated by Radiosurgery, if it is greater than 3 cm it needs surgery.Don't delay treatment because there is a serious risk of blindness. Consult a Neurosurgeon. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

output: Hello, I have studied your case. As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. If pain persist then you may need to do MRI again to see for any functional defect. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair, and same day you can go home. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.

input: Hi, i have pain accross the middle of my back just under my lungs, it isnt there all the time, when i sit on my knees and stretch forward then try and straighten myself, it seems to hurt then, i have been told by the doctor that my lungs are clear. What could this be?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely because your pain is associated with specific position and movement. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.

output: Hi, Welcome to the forum. I understand your condition. Multiple bilateral stones with swelling is not to be taken lightly.

input: I am a 62 years old Male. I underwent a brain MRI examination the outcome was: Few tiny hyperintense foci are seen in both frontoparietal and left anterior peri insular white matter, which appear to be ischaemic/nonspecific, with none showing restricted diffusion. Question : What does that mean?
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your MRI brain findings. I would like to reassure you that these findings are not significant and do not represent any serious brain disease. I would like to know your clinical details (history and examination findings) in order to completely interpret your MRI findings. Hyperintense loci on MRI are most often due to migraine and ischemia (lack of blood flow to brain). Ischemia of brain occurs in people with high BP and sugars. At this stage, you need to keep your blood pressure and sugar under good control. In addition, aspirin tablets may be taken to prevent further ischemia. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

input: Four years ago I had protected sex with a woman (I am male) and 3 days later had a terrible burning sensation on my penis and testicles. No rash or discharge, just terrible skin burning. Since then, it has come and gone, but always been slightly present. Sometimes, however, it becomes intolerable. I have been tested for all STDs several times, prostatitis and herpes four times - always with negative results. In fact, the most recent herpes blood test was done in December 2010, with negative results for both HSV1 and HSV2. I have also visited a urologist who did no tests and told me it was probably not a urology problem. A neurologist did some minor tests but found nothing. There are no marks, no lesions, no spots, no discharge, no bumps or anything other than an incredibly painful penis and testicles. Occasionally it "feels" like there are cuts or tears, but there has never actually been any. Sometimes, when I am standing it feels a little less painful. When I am sitting, the burning can also be felt in the thighs. Do you have ANY idea what this might be or what I could try to alleviate it? It has been many years and I am at my wits end. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

output: Hi Their understand your concern for your husband I would like to tell you that angiogram is only a diagnostic procedure that has no effect on sleeping pattern.

Hopefully this will help Kind Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: This is more a dentist question: I bashed the gum behind a back tooth the other week because of over brushing, and now the abscess has gone/stopped hurting it has left a kind of hole which fills with plaque and at the bottom as a couple of black dots in it. Nb I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was a teenager (I an now 28). I am arranging to go to a dentist for next weekend for them to see what is going on. My question is what could this hole be? Can it be filled in? Are the black dots I see nerve endings or blood vessel endings from when I had my teeth out?
output: Hello, As you are mentioning that you have noticed a hole inside the tooth with black dots, it looks like that there is tooth decay present there means cavity has been started. You should visit a good dentist to get it restored, as otherwise it will create other problems. Hope it will help you.

output: Hello ~ It seems like your brother has an anger management problem and impulsively becomes angry at little things.  However, it also seems like these anger episodes are predictable, which makes it amenable to treatment.  I suggest that your brother take anger management classes or complete a do-it-yourself book for anger management.  It is helpful to consult a psychiatrist if you or your brother feels like this is not helping and medications may hold a key to the question of anger. I hope this helps.  Take care.

input: My boyfriend is 23 years old and he came home from work complaining about a pain from his belly button to the tip of his penis. He explained it as a pulling sensation and it hurts worse when he leans backwards (stretching) I ve had kidney stones before and was wondering if that s what it is but he didn t have any pain in his kidney area recently.

input: I do not have a mirror where I can see what it looks like but behind my ear I have a discharge, infection. When I used an alcohol pad to clean behind my ear the pad had a brownish color to it. Behind my ear burns and hurts when I try to clean it. Is this a fungal or bacterial infection? I continuously have problems with my inner ears. I had an ENT to tell me it was allergy related. I have severe allergies and my inner ear problems (itching mostly) only occurs when my allergies flare up. I have been prescribed Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream to place in my ears when the itching inside the ears happen. Could the two be related?

While showering, do clean behind ears as otherwise infection may develop. If you have severe Dan Chat Doctor.  Keep the area clean. Wipe regularly with clean, soft cloth. Eat balanced diet.

My concern is that she is retaining fluid her belly is swollen, her ankles pratically all over.  Is there anything that can be done, what does this mean for her life.She is not taking any other medications.  She is strong and she is positive on all this.  Would she be a candidate for liver transplant.TksVicky
output: 1) palliative chemotherapy is for stage-4 cancers where there is no any other treatment option is available to cure cancer. Purpose of it is to relieve symptoms of patients and to improve quality of life. Palliative chemotherapy is not better stage.2) gall bladder cancer with liver metastasis is aggressive disease. It might affect liver function (formation of new proteins) depending upon spread of liver metastasis. Symptoms of fluid in belly, ankle swelling suggest less protein in body.3) she is candidate for palliative chemotherapy (but consider location and spread of metastasis in liver)

output: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough cardiothoracic assessment is advised. As the pain is persistent from past few months I will advise to take up a thorough cardio thoracic assessment if it is in the middle of the chest or above the abdominal region. You may be recommended x-ray or any other test based on the assessment the pain is below the xphisternum then I will advise to take a thorough abdominal assessment and a Diagnostic ultrasonography will be advised to see the soft tissue status. Also, if the pain is near to the rib joining the sternum then it could be Costco Chat Doctor. I will still advice to undergo at least a chest x-ray to check the soft tissue and bony status. No pain persists for longer months until there is something to understand about the physiology. Also, with breathing exercises if the pain subsides then you many not have to worry, as certain times due to weakness of the intercostal muscles there leads to pain. As no chest congestion, cough cold, abdominal pain is mentioned by you, I suspect it to be a Costco

input: Hi, i just gave myself a clexane injection in my stomach. It has air at the end which helps push out all the meds. This time i accidentally had the air bubble in the middle, so all the air was injected into my stomach. Is this dangerous or nothing to worry about? Thanks
output: H, A great question! The air if injected in the subcutaneous area will get absorbed by the body. A is in a very small amount, nothing serious will happen. Imagine when we Surgeons stitch the big wounds, so much air is trapped and nothing happens. (this is just to give an example).

input: my nine year old son has been complaining of a headache all day at school. He said that it started yesterday on the way home from a road trip. His eyes are blood shot and he looks miserable. no pain to light or sound however, when i tell him to touch his chin to his chest he says there is pain. It also hurts his neck at the base when i touch it. He also says that he just feelis icky. He is congested and has a cough that only seems to come on at night. This may be an over worried father but my 18 yo daughter went thru a bout of meningitis that was caught early by me and I just wann be sure. this could just be a common cold right? the pain when bending the neck is what worries me but it isnt terrible pain he says its like a pinch then it goes away. thoughts?
output: Hello dear! I can understand your concern. The pain which you are describing can't be meningitis as in this infection the child is quite sick and is unable to flex his neck. Its probably sinusitis or could be viral flu both of which can have headache. I would advise giving him some good anti histamines like levocetrizine 5 ml at night or fexofenidine 6 mg /loratadine 10 mg once in the morning before going to school. You can also try some home remedies like 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass of Luke warm water once daily. Normal saline(2 ml) nebulization and especially steam inhalation also helps. Dnt worry he will be fine in 2-3 days with all this. Get him an X-ray PNS done, and his eyesight checked because sometimes it could be due to refractive error. Hope it will help. Wishing your child a good health :-)

input: Hi, I took a Dollar store pregnancy test and it came out negative, but Im not sure if its accurate. Ive looked up common early signs of pregnancy, and I seem to have most of them. Is it possible that the test is wrong? Or that Ive taken it too early?
output: Hallow Dear, The routine urine test for pregnancy detection gives reliable results 8-10 days after missed period. If this test is done earlier, the chances of false negative tests are high. Beta Chat Doctor test is very specific and sensitive test. It gives reliable results within 2-3 days, or even before the missed period. Another test is ultrasonography. It gives direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. However, it also is reliable about a week to ten days after missed period. Hope this helps you.

I did have urinary tract infection about 6 or 8 weeks ago however. My doctor says the results of the blood work says the infection is gone. What should I think at this point?

There has to be a reason for this. No one seams to be able to or want to help. Any ideas?
output: Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! I am Infectious Disease Specialist! I went through your query! There are various causes of lymphadenopathy (Viral, bacterial, tubercular infection), lymphoma, leukemia, etc. You need thorough examination and set of investigations(ZN stain from FNAC and cytology) to come to diagnosis whether viral, bacterial or tubercular in nature. In your case as you have evening rise it is likely "Tubercular" in nature pulmonary or extra-pulmonary.

input: hey, so 4 days ago I was cleaning the bathroom at my work and I felt a really sharp pain in my neck and went all down my spinal cord. I could barely walk that day but as it progressed it got better. jump to the next day and ever since, I ve had majopr pain in my neck to the point where I can t move it to my right, and I have pain in my shoulders and a tingling in my left hand. I looked it up myself and the symptoms seem to be that of a slipped disc, but could there be something else, and what should my next step be?
output: Hi you have guessed it right these symptoms are probably of a disc prolapse in the cervical region and if the pain extends to the hand then lower discs may be involved.be on rest take analgesics get a MRI of the cervical spine done do not lift any weight on neck, do not excessively move the neck use cervical pillow. Traction may be helpful, and some doctors prefer a short course of steroids to reduce edema and pain.

input: My wife is concern with the seman dicharging after we have intercourse, my wife think something in wrong. One other question, i had a Vasotemy Reversal and it was sucessful but my sperm count is low, i am taking medicine for 3 month with very little change in the sperm count, can you give me some advice.
output: HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have undergone Vasectomy in the past and Vasectomy reversal very recently. Your semen analysis done very recently after reversal surgery is low. Normally there are very fewer chances of normal sperm count to be achieved, and it entirely depends upon the time gap between two surgeries as the anti sperm antibodies are formed after vasectomy which kill the sperms.

input: My father is suffering from vasculitis for three months treatment is going on from Sahara lucknow but the condition is getting worst now he is unable to do any movement and suffering from severe muscular pain what treatment should be done to relax him from this pain
output: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your father. As mentioned by you about the symptoms, since it is vasculitis we need to have patience for the bodies mechanism to function. As treatment of choice is always directed towards the symptoms. Also, as the fatigue and pain is the factor, taking physical therapy will be advised as per me depending upon the vascular assessment. By passive movements of the limbs it will help to maintain the normal muscle property and metabolism of the cells. Also breathing exercises will help improve the oxygen in blood cells, which will delay the fatigue and pain. Usually, physiotherapy is a non-invasive and no side effects' therapy. Avoid performing massage to increase the symptoms. Also icing can help. You can discuss the same with your vascular surgeon. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

input: hi my daughter is 6 years old its been a week since she has fever and cough took her 4 times by the doctor last night the doc say she has a chest infection he gave her ventolin,predcort ds and zithromax ....for the pass week i took her to 2 other docs an it was useless.cant u give me some addivice how to deal with this since all week she been under so many medication 3 different cough syrup
output: Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.I'm sorry to hear that about your child. How many doses of Zithromax have you given your child already. Usually, it takes 48 hours before you can see the effect of the antibiotics (like the fever goes down or may completely go away, child is regaining appetite) provided you give the proper dose as prescribed. Remember that the cough is the last to go away. If after 48 hrs your child worsens, it is best to bring to the hospital. Does your child have any history of asthma or allergic rhinitis. If yes, usually the course of a respiratory infection is prolonged. I hope your child feels better soon. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrician

input: Hello.I am 44 years old, and I am a seaman. Very often I was exposed to stressful situation, until about a year ago I had panic attack. I was feeling very scared when I was alone, thinking that I am going to die, I could not sleep in my bed because of some fear. If i have slept 2 hours I was awaking in panic and fear. Could not stay alone, could not concentrate on my job, constantly having bad thoughts passing through my mind. I have visited doctor who gave me Deanxit tablets, and after first one i felt amazingly better, only i had trouble sleeping. I was taking two tablets per day for about a month, than I signed off from the ship and stop with Deanxit. During vacation I have visited psychiatrist, explained what happened to me, and he told me that I have suffered panic attack. My psychiatrist has prescribed me SEROXAT - Paroxetin tablets, 20 mg, if happens againAfter two months at home, where everything was ok, only trouble sleeping from time to time, I have signed on another ship, and situation has started but not that strong as before.I have started taking Seroxat and everything was ok, only trouble sleeping again, and I have been taking Seroxat for full 4 months while I was on board the ship.Another two  months at home without tablets, but again trouble sleeping, and here I am on my present vessel, just signed on today.After talking with my family I am sensing and experiencing some kind of fear, now when I am alone in my room.Fear comes and goes, but I am still kind of afraid to go to sleep, even I am very tired.Thinking about taking Seroxat again or maybe Deanxit.Could you please tell me what to do and how and if is possible to treat this fear permanently.Thank you very much.

input: Hello,I got a discomfort under my jaws, on both sides for the past the few days now. I did notice that it really comes up when I drink alcohol (colder or room temperature, it doesnt matter). I have no fever, but I do feel fatigue and tired. For the past few months I only get max 6 hours of sleep and eat very irregularly, I also smoke. That along with being stressed often makes me think that the tiredness is a result from there.

output: Suspicious densities mean the radiologist isn't sure whether there are densities or not and if there are then what ? Apicolordotic view will confirm whether there are densities or not, as the clavicle will not obstruct the view. Most probably it looks like tuberculosis if there are upper lobe densities, however we need to do further investigations to confirm and clinically confirm a disease

input: Greetings Doctor. My child - 6yrs recently had an episode of convulsion and we visited our padeatric and he started him with Valparin 200mg half tablet twice in a day and recommended to vist a neurologist.

input: My 11 month old has had a round lump on the back of her head on one side in the middle since birth.  The doctor said this would probably go away as the skull shaped but it is still there.  her ears and everything are normally positioned and she is starting to crawl and is very normal in every way.  What is the round lump?  it isnt huge, just different than the othe
output: Thanks for the quarry. The back of head lump which is hard is due to protruded cockpit. This some time suture line fusion site. Other cases can be a small occipital lymph node. Advise is just ignore it when the baby will grow this will disappear with time due skull molding and reshaping. Or you can use occipital soft ring or pillow for shaping occipital round shape.

output: HiI may suggest an x-ray of lower spine and consultation with orthopedic doctor He may take Tramadol or Vicodin tab for pain. Also make him sit in tub filed with hot water (site bath) for 10 minutes twice a day. Tail end of spine called coccyx may be inflamed called coccidynia-its a painful condition.

input: Why does my body feel wierd one day Im dizzy headache the next day Im tired and feel discomfort in my upper chest area and other days feels like my body wants to give up. I just feel wierd and dont know what to think. I get worried alot and stress out so I really dont know if that maybe the cause. I always think I feel like its my heart but I was checked before and its not that. I know when I did some cardio workout for a lil while couple days of the week my body felt so much better. So what could it be??
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. Your symptoms are improving with Cardio workout. Heart and lung diseases actually precipitate after Cardio workout. So possibility of major heart and lung diseases is very less. Stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: My AORTIC VALVE was replaced 10 years ago twice in a span of 17 days since the first open heart surgery had gone bad on account of one of the suitchers had opened very next day. Since then, I am on CLAVIX 75 and ACITROM 1mg/2mg per day and the INR Values are ranging between1.15 to 1.58 and at times it shoots up to 13/14 when I start urinating blood. I am taking the following medicines besides CLAVIX 75 and ACITROM : - Remistar 5 mg - 1 BD,Lanoxin 6/7, Frusalac DS 1 OD, Amtas 5 1 OD, Arkamin 1 BD and Derriphylin Retard 150 mg 1 BD. Kindly advise if I should continue with CLAVIX 75 and ACITROM?
output: I presume that you have metallic prosthetic valve, i feel you may discontinue Plavix .and stop temporarily citron if INR is above 13,also evaluate yourself for any urological abnormality causing hematuria. Once INR returns around 2 you should restart Citron.

input: Hi I went to urgent care today, haven t been feelin well. Extreme nausia, loose stools and headaches . A few months ago I had What I believed to be gallstones, the pain was severe but after an hour or two pain subsided so I never sought treatment, now I get dull pains upper right abdominal under rib, but not as painful as I had experienced before, I also had some blood in my stool for 2 days which has currently stopped. But I had a UA done about a month ago that came back with abnormal WBC when culture and sensitivity was done it came back negative. At urgent care today my Bloodwork came back fine but my UA showed 500 count leukocytes. I m going to have ct done of gallbladder . I am a 20 year old female , any idea what could be wrong
output: Hi young lady, you do have both gastrointestinal and urinary problems from the information provided. The CT scan will give us some information about how your kidneys and gallbladder look. Are you having any white discharge per vagina which is contaminating the urine? Infection of the urinary tract is the most common cause of pus cells in the urine. Repeat the culture. If repeated cultures are negative and there is no kidney stone on CT scan, you will need tests to look for causes of Sterile Syria. Blood in stools is not due to gallstones nor urine infection - it needs further assessment. Most commonly it is due to hemorrhoids (piles), but a doctor (surgeon/ GP) should examine you to confirm or negate this.

input: Hello, Doctor! If I may ask, is there any danger of overdosing on a birth control pill? I took 4 today to catch up. I have PCOS and my doctor advised me to take Diane35.
output: Hi, Overdosing up to two pills is done to make up for a missed pill, but taking four pills at a time is not going to help make up the missed doses and the cycle is no longer protected. You may also see a breakthrough bleeding due to excessive hormone levels. Other side effects like rashes, nausea, breast tenderness or abdominal pain, apart from vascular disturbances, may also be seen with high doses. I do not think you should be using some other form of pill once you are on Diane 35. You are amply protected if you are regular with your medication. Hope this helps.

input: My daughter and son in law have been trying for 2 years to have a baby. In that time they have suffered 2 miscarriages. They have 1 unsuccessful attempt at artificial insemination and 1 unsuccessful IVF treatment. The doctors say it is unexplained infertility. They are both healthy in every way. So I discovered the Natura Cure product and want to know if it is safe and worth giving it a try before I recommend it to them?
output: Hi, I have gone through your query. NaturaCure is a herbal product, and it claims to treat infertility, but Success has not been documented. It is better to avoid all these products. As you have mentioned that they have gone for IVF also, then there may be some abnormality in semen analysis or uterine problem in your daughter. You can upload their reports on my page so that I can have look at it. Better than Naturalize, give him Oligocene and her Ova care. Hope I have answered you. You can contact me on my page http://bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Regards

input: My son 5 years old is suffering from high fever around 103 def F and complaining throat infection . It seems to be a viral fever. We had ice cream and food outside yesterday. . Pls advise, we can use the Crixan Syrup with Ibugesic plus. or Advise accordingly. regards rakesh
output: Hello Rakesh. I'm sorry to hear that about your son. Did the fever only start today? How is he after you give the fever medicine? Is he active and eating well? Fever can be due to a viral or bacterial infection. Aside from the throat pain, does he have colds or cough? For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Eugenic or Paracetamol) in between fever episodes. The throat infection caused by viruses is usually accompanied by colds. Viral infections are not given antibiotics like Azithromycin or Brian. It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already. You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses. For this you will need antibiotics that is properly computed based on your children weight. I hope I was able to help you. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics

output: Hello, I can understand your concern. Kindly share the total semen analysis report. The sperm count is low in your husband. There is no information about the number of live sperms.

input: hi ive been suffering lower abdominal pain now for 7 months ive been to the gp numerous times and have been referred for an ultrasound scan, recently after sexual intercourse i started bleeding bright red fresh blood, after the intercourse myself and my partner could feel like a lump on the front wall of my cervix and abdominal pain increased
output: Hi, thank you for your query, Vaginal bleeding, and a cervical mass may indicate the presence of malignancy. Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from cells originating in the cervix uteri. The pain in your lower abdomen is mostly because of the lump on the cervix. The most common cause for cervical cancer is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)At this point i would suggest you to undergo a basic Pap Screening and a further Biopsy of the lump to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on that your OB/GUN will start the prescribed treatment.thanking you, wishing you good health

output: Hello, Vasculitis is not contagious at all. You can meet your family. It is an autoimmune disorder, in which our own antibody attacks our own healthy cells and tissues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: My grandmother recently passed away from gallbladder cancer and i have a lot of questions about her death. I feel like they made her pass away faster then she was suppose to. I can be wrong but i would like to investigate my grandmother death because something doesnt seem right. She was 75 year old and the doctor just found out she had gallbladder cancer and they had surgery on her and tried to cut it and he said it spreaded. I thought thats very high risk with her being that old. Ever scince then my poor grandmother. Could not eat,talk,smile she couldnt even open her eyes.they put her in hospice she didnt even stay in their for a week she passed within 2days. I want to get to the bottom of this because it doesnt sound right. She couldnt even say anything to any of her kids and grandkids before she passed away. Someone please help me!
output: Gall bladder cancers are silent killers. By the time the cancer is detected the tumor will have usually spread to the liver making treatment futile and survival poor. Surgery attempts at removing as much of the tumor mass as possible in order to reduce the tumor load to prolong life and make the residual tumor more susceptible to anti-cancer Chat Doctor. Overall prognosis in gall bladder tumors is very poor.

input: Hi, i just wanted to get some information on herpes type 1. Ive been dating this girl with it and she rarely gets cold sores to me i beleive its minor but i never get more information about it from her and i researched alot about it lately but everything is still the same. She told me she would tell me if she had a breakout but im scared and i really care about her. I sometimes afraid to kiss her even when her face is clear (which it usually always is). Can you please help me with some information on being able to coup with it and if i would be able to show any affection to her at all?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Herpes type 1 infection causes cold sores over the lips and face and commonly involves the lips. In case if a person has a history of cold sores he/she tend to transmit infection to other individuals by close contact like kissing and using things like glass, towels etc. But in case if there is no cold sore present then the viral count seems to be very low over the skin of infected individual, although it does not become zero. But in this condition the individual is considered clean and chances for other person to get infected are less.Moreover, you can go for her blood investigation to rule out for viral count so that the exact status can be clear. But in case if her skin is completely clear then you are at a lesser risk of getting infected. She should also take a long course of antiviral medications to prevent recurring episodes of outbreak of infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

My right heel clicks, I have burning pain to top of feet and middle toe left foot is painful. Walking is becoming quite traumatic and I can hardly get down stairs in the mornings.

input: Hi Doctor I am 35 weeks pregnant and am experiencing regular trembles or shakes in my tummy, like the baby is having a small seizure or like when an adult has that weird involuntary tremble down the back of the neck. What is this? and is it normal? Thanks Lishai
output: Hallow Lisa, The baby inside the uterus is continually moving. It is calm when the baby is sleeping. This movement is felt by the mother from about 20 weeks of the gestation or earlier. As the pregnancy advances, the water around the baby goes on diminishing and hence the movements of the baby are more perceived. You may please count the score of the movements. During 12 hours time if it is moving about 10 times, you do not have to worry. This is normal and is indicating a healthy active fetus. Any variation in the fetal movement count needs to be reported to the Obstetrician. I hope this helps you. 

input: I am 38 Yr Old man. I am having a female child of 5 years old. I am suffering from varicocele problem fully on left side and mild on right side. on having none sperm count i undergo homeopathic treatment for 6 months and my sperm count increases to 25 millions / cumm. and motility 23 % active., volume 3.0 ml ph  - 8.2 70% of morphology is normal. whether fertyl 25 helps me  to improve my counts . i need your suggestion to get second child. my wife is normal.
output: Hihaving varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility, I would like to know the complete semen analysis report for better advise. If you are having varicocele then you should be more worried about the decreased motility of sperms rather than the sperm count as varicocele leads to qualitative defect rather than quantitative defect, moreover you have sperm count of 25 million which is good enough for fertilization.I would recommend you to start cap.Evian and tab. Lycopene which are natural antioxidants, and they will improve the health of sperms, secondly I would advise you to get operated for your varicocele as varicocele cause States of blood in testis, and it increases the temperature within the testes which causes the sperms to die or deform ultimately causing reduced sperms' motility.

input: hi,i am 28 yrs old single girl, i have problem with irregular menstruation and i am worried about  is there will be any problem to conceive?also,i am having breast tenderness and pain before my periods. and i am always embarrassed about my small breast as i am 28yrs.so please provide me good suggestion accordingly.
output: Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Yes irregular cycles cause infertility.  So I suggest you following investigations to know the cause of irregular cycles and take treatment accordingly.-- thyroid profile, serum prolactin, ultrasound abdomen to rule out polycystic ovary disease (PCs). The pain in breast during cycles is seen in some people. Don't worry about that. You can take primrose tablet after consulting your doctor and painkiller. Normally breast develop in proportionate to body. If you still feel your breasts are small compared to your body then for external appearance you can wear thick padded bra. For your sexual life, then you can go for breast enlargement surgery by a plastic surgeon. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi, Im 29 years old, regular paps and regular periods.  Ive been off birth control for 2 years and have not conceived.  Is it normal after intercourse for his siemen to come out?  Does any of it stay in?  I keep thinking there is something wrong with me.
output: Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1. First do not panic 2. As you have regular cycles, please get ovulation study on USG from day 10 of the cycle to know about the day of ovulation. 3. Post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography, within first ten days of the cycle will be helpful to know about the patency of fallopian tubes. 4. Please get husbands semen analysis done with abstinence of 3 to 5 days.  This helps to know about quality and quantity of sperms. 5. You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around the day of ovulation. 6, Lastly, about your concern of seminal fluid coming out of vagina. Normally, the motile sperms start travelling inside the womb and the seminal fluid remains in the vagina. This fluid leaks out of vagina after some time.  So you need not worry about it.  I hope this answer helps you May God bless you with a bundle of joy. Thanks. 

input: I am a vet tech at a small animal hospital. I was scratched during a dog nail trim a week ago. It has almost fully healed but now I m getting sever pain in my arm from the elbow to my hand, on the bottom side (sensitive ski. Area) is there any concern from the scratch or is this something totally different? No swelling and no rash.
output: Hi, Thank you for contacting us. I will to ad Chat Doctor.  The single most important thing to rule out here is an infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for bite wounds to prevent infection in certain situations. For example, if:1. You have been bitten by a cat. All cat bites are usually treated with antibiotics, as they are much more likely to get infected than dog bites.2. The bite wound is on an arm or leg - especially a hand. These sites are particularly prone to nasty infections that can cause severe damage after a dog or cat bite.3. The wound is large, deep or punctured. A puncture wound may not look large but may go deep into the tissues.4. Your injury needed an operation to clean it out, or repair the damage.5. Your resistance to infection is low. For example, if you are on chemotherapy; have no working spleen; have diabetes; have an immune system problem such as AIDS.6. You have an artificial heart valve (and sometimes, if you have an artificial joint). Antibiotics will also be prescribed if your wound has already become infected. It might be infected if:It is getting more painful rather than improving as time goes by. It has become red or swollen. It is oozing. Sometimes the doctors exam will discover some red lines in the skin of the arm - this is known as lymphangitis - this also needs antibiotics. Best to get this checked by your doctor as soon as possible. I hope this helps. Please message me back if you have any further questions. Best wishes and I hope you get better soon.A

output: Hello, In case of post chikungunya in a good number of cases there are chances of having joint pain. This is due to an immune reaction with joints. As you have already consulted your physician and there is a confirmation diagnosis then I will suggest you following for relief:1. Take a mild analgesic like diclofenac 100 mg on your doctor advice2. I used to treat severe pain in such cases witChatDoctorbination of pregabalin. You may discuss this with your doctor3. Do mild warm fomentation over knee4.

input: hi. My name is Cathie, i m a 56 y.o. woman, caucasion, obese, and I suffer from Type 2 diabetes x 20 yrs., chronic depression and chronic pain. Lately I can t sleep.[1-2hrs/24 hrs,] my major symptom is a twitchy, spasm all over my body. do you think you could tell me what is happening?
output: Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the twitchy spasm all over your body may be a disorder called myoclonus or myoclonic jerk. It may be caused by different problems like : seizures, diabetic amyotrophic or polineuropathy. It is very common during sleep, in patients with diabetes. I would recommend monitoring your blood glucose better, and have an Electroneurography and an EEG to exclude the above-mentioned disorders. If I were your doctor I would recommend treatment with clonazepam. It is a very effective Chat Doctor.  Other therapy I would recommend would be Pyrimidine, L'Oréal etc. Hope to have been of help! Thank you for using Chat Doctor! Best wishes,

I am unable to get in touch with my primary or a specialist. Is it alright for me to increase the dose to 150 mg/BD. i am also Dx with Hypothyroidism and take Levothyroxine now at dose of 50 mg/OD. I was taking armourthyroid 60mg/OD but cannot find that medication hence the change

input: For the past several months, my 42 year old husband has been experiencing headaches, dizziness, light headed, weakness, fatigue, unstable blood pressure going really high or really low with no in between, night sweats, and says he s freezing a lot in the evening hours. No fever. He s had exams/blood work for diabetes, etc. along with MRI and stress test, which all report back normal. He has passed out with these symptoms. It appears to get worse each week. There s definitely something going on with him but we re not getting results from family physician or ER physicians. I truly feel he may have a blockage decreasing blood flood to the brain. Yes, he has smoked since he was 15-16 years old. Please advise.
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms could be related to blood pressure fluctuations. It is important to investigate for the possible causes of these blood pressure fluctuations. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests (if you have not performed them yet): - blood electrolytes- PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- a Head Up Tilt test for possible orthostatic hypotension. Considering the fact that he has been smoking for such a long time, I would also recommend performing a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries. Hope you will find this answer helpful!

input: hi.. my dad, 93y/o very physically active b4 he had cough/sob that seeked him admission 2 d hosp. on 9/14/14. right now, he s been treated 4pneumonia..he was in ICU 4close monitoring, 2r/o pneumothorax vs. atelectasis.. had chest tube inserted 2drain out excess air..chest tube still in since his admission. his Dr. advised him to have surgery to repair d collapsed lungs.m my questions are..1. how long can a chest tube stay in to drain d air out? 2. is it advisable to have surgery to repair his lungs at his age? 3. his pneumonia hasn t been r/o jst yet.. he s given Zithromax 500mg iv q24hrs..what is best to do, considering not much antibiotics to choose from in the PHILIPPINES on top of high costs.. ThNKS A LOT FOR D RESPONSE...
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Surgery is not at all advised at this age (93). Because lung surgery is considered as major surgery and heart lung bypass is needed during surgery. And chances of post-operative complications are very high at this age. So I will not advise surgery for him because of his age. Better to keep ICD and wait for resolution of pneumothorax. Better to get done sputum culture to identify organism. And also get done sensitivity report to guide the antibiotic therapy. Once infection is resolved, pneumothorax will definitely subside. So discuss all these with your doctor and plan accordingly.

What could be causing this? Also my period is very late and Im certain this is not due to pregnancy. I am 42 years old.

output: Hello, I will suggest you to continue the spine strengthening exercises as advised by a professional physiotherapist. Avoid over straining your spine. Do not lift heavy weights. Do not lean down to lift a weight placed on floor. Sit in a lordosis posture (your tummy protruding in front) on chair. If you need to lift a weight from floor you need to sit on floor first and stand up with a strong support. If physiotherapy keeps your spine healthy you can wait on being operated. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

He is home now but he is itching on his buttocks and on the sides of his genital area. What creams or medication can I try with him. I have tried the cortizone and lotrimin but it is not working.

input: i have a 5 year son who for about a week now is having these random coughing spurts and sometime will make him vomit.  he does not have any fever but very fatigue.  it sometimes happens atleast 4 to 5 times a day.  he cannot even talk during these spouts of coughing.
output: Hi...by what you quote I feel that he might be having a pertussis cough and the infection would have been caused by an atypical organism. If the child is coughing in bouts and the eyes are becoming red and face is becoming red during the cough bout and if after cough he is having a whooping inspiratory noise then it could be whooping cough or pertussis cough. I suggest you consult your pediatrician and get an antibiotic prescription and a cough suppressant. Once started this type of cough can last for 4-6 weeks. Regards -

input: My 8 year old daughter and her family returned to summit county, co (elevation HIGH!) from NY a few weeks ago and she was having pretty bad nose bleeds for a week.

input: Have taken azithromycin for bronchial asthmatic infection. Taking 250 mg for last 4 days. Have one pill left. My condition is completely better but the med. is causing me to have a bad stomach and a dizzy feeling. Would it do any harm if I didn t take that last pill?
output: Hello,First bronchial asthma is not an infection. It is a condition in which there is spasm of bronchial muscles and air pipe which causes breathing difficulty. Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course. And next time if you again get the infection by the same infective agent, the antibiotic won't work the next time, and you will need higher antibiotic. So whenever you are put on any antibiotic make sure you complete the course as per prescribed by your doctor. I hope I have given you satisfactory answer. Thank you

input: Hi Respected doctor, My sister in law is 62 years and general medical specialist referred her to cardiologist for stress thalliumtest/debulleaine plus minusCA-RP. She is diabetic for the last 22 years. We consulted the cardiologist who after seeing the history and on going treatment first conducted TMT and then advised and carried out angiography, Angiography report is as underHTN, DMII, CA-DOE, TMT moderately positive(21/03/11) and CAG-Triple VesselDisease(22,03.11)Past History k/c/o DMII 22 yrs on reglar Medicine ,HTN since 20 yrs on regular medicineNo H.o RHD/BA.TB/ other chronicillnessangio graphy report as  followsLmca  normalLAD MID AND DISTA lad-SEVERE CALCIFICATION,LONG TUBULAR 70 PERCENT Stenosis   Ds normalLCX    Co Dominent VesselOMs-OMI-Diffused DiseasedRCA Dominent Vessel- Mid RCA 75 percent stenosis    PLV/PDA-NormalLV ANGIO NOT DONEFINAL DIAGNOSES  CAD, Triple Vessel Disease                             DMII,TMT POSITIVE (MODERATELY)RECOMMENDATION   Stress Thallium for Inducible Ischemia.Now  we are advised to go in for Thallium Test. Kindly advise whether Thallium test only as recommended by medical specialist should have been carried out before  Angiography or the cardiologist has used his discretion as we are laymen and did not know about thallium test . If thallium test was not available in cardiologists clinic/hospital  why he did not refer us to another hospital where Nuclear Science test facility for Thallium test was available. ALso we shall be grateful  for the correct advice at this stage to safeguard the interest of the patient ,.REGARDS
output: After having gone through the reports and the finding of triple vessel disease on coronary angiography, i don't think stress thallium would achieve anything much as far as diagnosis is concerned.  It has probably been advised because TMT has come put to be moderately positive instead of being strongly positive which would be expected with the angiography findings. She mostly needs a coronary area by pass surgery (CABG).

input: hi, about a year ago i took kenalog injection for a keloid on my leg. now, d skin around site of injection is much lighter than my skin (i am dark skinned) and slightly dented. i read it usually reverts with time but i am tired of waiting. is there anything i can do about it? especially d color. thanks

input: Why is it that if I believed doctors I would have already been dead three times? Now I have prostate cancer two doctors told me only surgery, and other suggested radiation . I refused all of these, and took two herbs that stopped the symptoms in three weeks that I had for more than a year. Yes, I could die in a couple more years as they expected, but I would rather die than have surgery.
output: Hi, I am extremely sorry to know the condition. I want to assure you that prostate cancer is slowly progressive disease. The treatment depends on the stage. You have not mentioned any detail of investigation. Specially serum PSA, Gleason score, and invasion size and lymph node status to be mentioned. In early stage if life expectancy is more (like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered. As they have offered surgery or RT probably your disease is at early stage. Anyway if you do not want surgery then go for radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can be given Dy image guided technique and is non-invasive. Minimal toxicity is there. Adjuvant hormone therapy will be prescribed also. There is a good chance of total tumor control. Consult your radiation oncologist.

input: I feel like I constantly need a wee like someone has put a weight in my bladder and everytime I go to the toilet after a few seconds I m in so much pain that I m nearly crying or make a painful noise and I have to stop myself from weeing. I thought it was just normal after I had sex about 3 weeks ago but it has been on and off a lot since then and it s resulted in me holding in my wee because I don t like going to the toilet

input: Ive been in hospital twice during the last 3 weeks... first they thought it was galstones or blood clot through my lung.  It started with pain in my lower back... felt like the start of labour... then it moved to the front over my liver and I had some stabbing pain too.... the to just below my sternum (very sore when I breath in ).... then I also had pain in my right shoulder and up the right ride of my neck. They could not find blood clots or galstones.... my bloods seemed normal except for CRP 92 and D-dimer 663 and after the third test they told me my liver function was slightly off...Bili 12, ALP102,GGT43,ALT61, CRP 11. By week two the pain was much less and they send me home with antibiotics.  Now another week on.... I feel like something get stuck under my ribs - feels like when a baby pushes with his feet against it (not sore, but pressure).... I also get a feeling of movement in my stomach from time to time... again like when you are pregnant... I am not!!!  Had my period a week ago.... and I am 46.  They also found a haemangioma in my liver during the scan, but said it was small and could not have caused the pain (1-2cm). I am worried about this... something is not right.
output: Hello, Welcome at Chat Doctor. I have read details of your question. As per your details, it looks to be a pain due to gall bladder problem. There can be inflammation of gall bladder which is not detected by other investigations. At present, you should have HIDE scan. This is a test which is able to detect the dysfunction of gall bladder, which may be the reason for your pain. Hope this will help you. With best wishes.

input: I broke my wrist 3 weeks ago today (compression fracture) and my fingers are still swollen and it cracks a lot. Is this normal? I have not taken any pain medication and by far am not a baby about pain, but I would say this is most often very uncomfortable.
output: Hi, As mentioned in history about the compression fracture, were you in the cast for 3 days? If so then this is just weakness of the muscles and will become better with simple exercise of the hand and wrist. Using hot water fermentation for relaxing the muscle will be also helpful before the exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

input: i am just trying to report something that happened to me upon taking flexiril. 2 days after beginning to take it, I pulled a muscle in my right lower back while doing virtually nothing. 4 days later, I was feeling better then I pulled the muscle in my lower left back. again, for doing almost nothing. It has now been over 2 weeks and I am still recovering. I am worried that this might be my new normal state. If so, I am screwed. I quit taking the drug and my recovery has been extremely slow. I don t know if anyone else has had similar problems.
output: Hello, As a tablet, Flexeril is also a muscle relaxant, but your symptoms not relieved. You can take tablet Myosins D instead of that. Along with that, you continue with physiotherapy as advised. Take rest for some days. You can do an x-ray back or MRI back after consultation. You can apply Diclofenac gel or Voting spray. I will suggest you review here with detailed history or consult with the orthopedic with reports. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: My husband is 60 yrs ols and has been suffering from fatigue and being very cold all the time. He looks like he lost weight also. He coaches ice hockey(28) yrs. And can t tolerate the cold. I am wondering how concerned we should be. He is only on cholesterol medication.
output: Hello,,, at 60 yrs fatigue with loss of weight, is a point of concern. You need to have him tested for diabetes and thyroid straight away. Then a general health check for not so common problems. Also, let him stop the cholesterol tablets for a month and see how he feels. This tablet can cause muscle pains which may be interpreted as weakness. Also, consider adding It D, Vitamin B1B6B12 along with Zinc as tablets. A general health check up with an X-ray chest would be essential.

input: I just noticed recently that the small of my back looks pretty bruised, and isnt straight. there is pretty noticeable curvature just in that spot! My left side hurts from my spine all the way around to the front on my left side from top to hip bone. And I have some kind of swollen lumps behind my right ear along the bottom of my hairline, and they hurt. I can feel it when I turn my head, and I can not press on that whole area behind the right ear into the back of the neck..
output: Hello, Firstly swelling behind your right ear may be postauricular lymph nodes. It may be due to ear infection or any infection in the surrounding area and scalp. Secondly regarding the spine, there may be any intervertebral disc prolapse with bony degeneration. Most probably Spot spine is a possibility.

input: Hello, on the left side of my mouth my gums are swollen inbetween two teeth and the whole left side of my gums are red and tender. The lining of my gums hurt and there is white lines. Also underneath my jaw (i think it is my glands) hurt to touch. What could this be and should I see and doctor or a dentist? Thank you for your help. I am really worried this is the beginning stages of mouth cancer . I am scared because I did smoke on and off for 7 years. I am 23 now.
output: Hellion the basis of your dental history these white lines could be white precancerous lesion like leukoplakia. But proper clinical diagnosis and biopsy will confirm edit.I would advise advice you to show this to an oral pathologist and get a biopsy done .please maintain your oral hygiene. Use mouthwash twice daily and get cleaning of your teeth done since you are a smoker. Plz give up smoking because this will worsen the condition. Have high nutrition diet.

input: Hello, I had dry cough and I was coughing continuously, Went to nearest medicine shop and told the symptom to the concerned person he gave me Almox 500 after consuming coughing has subsided but acute running nose has started. Is this because of medicine that I have consumed???
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, your symptom of running nose is not due to Almost tablet. Almost is amoxicillin. It is penicillin group of antibiotic. It does not cause running nose. You are mostly having viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). This is the cause for your cough and running nose. So better to Chat Doctor.

output: Hi...if the baby is comfortable you need not worry at all. Usually some babies try to regurgitate the feeds soon after feeding. This is physiological. You need to worry only if the babies weight gain is not appropriate. Regards - 

input: Hi doctor, good evening. My mother (92yrs) has this artritis-like 2 lumps (5mm high each) on first joint of her right middle finger, pain on touch. What are the precautions, what to take, or rub, to relief the pain, and therapy? Is voltaren gel advisable or can you please suggest anything else I can do or give her? Do voltaren gel and oral type can cause the same side effects and adverse reactions? Thank you Christina
output: Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you mom. A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As she is 92, I will advise to undergo physical therapy, as by the use of therapeutic ultrasound therapy the inflammation will be reduced. Since due to arthritis the joints get swollen, also with little of strengthening exercises like pressing the ball should help her. In my clinical practice I see geriatrics and 99% of times, physical therapy helps them to be functionally active and avoid much of the pain and aches due to systemic illness. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. 

input: I thought I sprained my ankle badly week and a half ago and did the RICE therapy. On Monday I saw an orthopedist who said I had actually fractured my fibula and put me in an air cast. She said I could walk without crutches on the cast and that my swelling would go down. My foot is still swollen, but the troubling thing is that in the past 2 days I have gotten extremely light headed and felt like I was going to faint (this has never happened before). This has happened after long periods of walking/moving around. Could this be related to my ankle?
output: Hello, What I would say is this nowhere related to the fracture of the fibula.  Next thing I would like to know are you on any medications? If so please check this could be related to that. Also, what is your age? Are you on any High blood pressure medication? Are you diabetic? If the above one doesn't fit your category than this should be just having weakness of the body and nothing else. For swelling, I would advise you to keep the leg elevated over a pillow at most times because you have a cast applied and also there is very less mobility, so there will be an obvious chance of reduced venous return. Keeping the leg elevated helps more. Try having Lemon juice with added auger and pinch of salt for dizziness. Rest assured, you should do well.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Jay In Chat Doctor. 

input: Last night I noticed a small red patch on the shaft of my penis and a small bump barely 2x2 mm. Its been 5 days since I last had sex which was protected. The red mark is slightly irritating though I think it might just be due to my own periodic self examinations. The surface around the bump is sometimes shiny as if moist. The seems no bigger then a nodule for a hair but I can see any hair coming from it and Im not sure if its an ingrown or not.
output: HelloThanks for query. Red patch with small bumps on glans penis after having protected sex is mostly due allergic reaction to chemicals in condom used as lubricant. You need to take broad spectrum antibiotic like Definite along with anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Along with topical steroid cream of combination of antibiotic and steroid like Newsprint H for local application twice daily. Ensure to wash your genitals with warm water twice daily. Ensure to avoid sexual encounters till it heals up completely.

input: hi,i have recently discovered that i have klebsiella spp, after having a complete digestive stool analysis done.  i have suffered badly with diaharreh for 2 years and 6 doctors later i have been given cefaclor monohydrate 375mg twice a day to treat it.  after taking it for 10days i was again sick so went back and saw another doctor (as mine was away on hollies)  this doctor then told me that i would need to take it a lot longer than 10 days.  Im confused and not sure how long i should be on it.  Im scared if i dont have them long enough i wont kill this bacteria bug off. Help! Kim
output: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Usually Klebsiella bacteria are pathogenic in the respiratory tract and urinary tract but not on the GIT or diarrhea. We can count these bacteria as a communal flora of the intestine and can ignore its presence in the stool. So in my opinion you should not take the Chat Doctor. Pathology for diarrhea may be something different and so can be diagnosed and treated accordingly.Maybe you have taken the long-lasting antibiotics that has washed of your communal flora. I advise you to take the probiotics like Lactobacillus spore. This help replaces the flora and can help in prevention of diarrhea. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/

input: Hi, On Friday my mid-back started to hurt on the right side of my spine . The length of the pain would be about 4 inches along my spine. Since Friday, it has gradually gotten worse to where it is swollen (to the right of my spine on the mid side) and hurts to move in any way. At first, I tried heating pads but they didn t seem to help. Ice seems to feel good on it when using it now. The only thing that takes the severe pain away is Tylenol but when it wears off the severe pain comes back. I m not aware of anything that would have caused this. I was doing physical activity on Wednesday and thought it could have been related, but I didn t feel any pain in my back until Friday and since it has gotten worse I m unsure it is just a muscle pull. Any thoughts to what I might have or what might help? Thanks
output: Consult a doctor preferably spine specialist and don`t treat yourself and yes rest till then

input: hi, im michelle and im 20, ive had a stroke 3 years ago and now im wearing a walk aid on my right leg. however, the right side is affected and i cant feel anything. although, recently, my right heel hurts. i did some research and the two that popped out the most is the heel busitis and heel spur. usually its fine in the morning but then it right leg and heel hurts like crazy. should isee a doctor or possibly take some treatments. what do you think?
output: Hi, as mentioned by you the brief history of you I will recommend to first take an x-ray and confirm that it's a spur. Also, post that your physician may help with treatment which will help ease the symptoms. Next to understand is that this spur once confirmed needs an attention by doing some exercises for feet and also getting a shoe insole. Which will help further to avoid the pain and reduce the inflammation.regards. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

input: I am concerned about my sons swollen axillary lymph node. It is 1cm in size, movable, soft but has been there for 2 1/2 months.  The doctor has said there is no need for biopsy, as it is small ,not getting bigger and there are no other prominent nodes. His CBC shows a normal WBC profile but his RBC is microcytic, hypo chromic. His eosinophils are about 10 times normal . He has been given worm medicine and has been on a course of iron therapy for 2 months but the follow up blood work still shows no change. Should the lymph node be biopsied?
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The axillary lymph nodes filter the lymph from the arm, chest wall and breast. It is often difficult to feel normal axillary lymph nodes. Not all enlarged axillary lymph nodes feel the same. Axillary lymph nodes may swell from an injury or infection to the arm or hand. A rare cause of axillary swelling may be breast cancer or lymphoma. I would suggest you to take your son to pediatrician for physical examination and to find out the reason for the palpable axillary lymph node. Thank you.

input: Hi. I am 23 years old, and very rarely drink alcohol (every 2-3 months) the last couple of times I have consumed alcohol, within 15 minutes I have suffered severe upper right chest pains. This happened last night after half a glass of wine - and the chest pains lasted through the night. Along with this I was unable to sleep as suffered a serious chill. Should I be worried?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are mostly having alcohol induced HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Alcohol causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain. So better to avoid alcohol. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: hi, My age is 44 years and I have been undergoing infertility treatment for past 6 months. I have done IUI in Oct but no results. Next cycle was put on medicines and after 44 days my legs started to swell. Had met the doctor and she advised for tests and all tests normal. My endometrium is 13mm thick and one folicule is available now in right ovary. pls advise why my legs are swollen and any effect of thick endometrium?
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The causes of the swelling of the feet are hypovitaminosisB, anemia, heart failure, etc. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment.  In such a health condition, with one mature follicle, the chances of conception are very less, still you can try.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods, to provide relief of some conditions.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

output: Hello, The life liver enzymes could be due to both alcohol and weight. I would suggest you get blood tests for hepatitis B and C as both these can cause raised enzymes in case they are negative I would suggest completely stopping alcohol and repeat liver enzymes after 6 to 8 weeks. The levels are not alarmingly high but if not controlled can lead to permanent liver damage in the future. Hope this helped get back in case you have further queries Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: This may seem pretty silly, well it is very silly but I m a bit paranoid.. I fingered my girlfriend today, but then I had to adjust myself, I didn t touch my penis, I adjusted it over my pants, I was wearing two layers (briefs and shorts) I didn t feel any precum on my pants but in the moment I may not have, and then used my fingers to well go at it again... I doubt there was any precum on my fingers as I don t think it could get through two layers of cloth but in case it did what are the chances of her getting pregnant..? I don t generally have a lot of precum, the usual drop or two Please help, I m just a little freaked out
output: Hi, There is no chance of pregnancy in your case as you described your act. You are on both brief and pant. You did finger your girlfriend without touching to penis. If you have touched penis then also extremely fewer sperm can attaché to finger. By fingering, sperm can not enter in to vagina. Sperm require seminal fluid as a liquid medium for movement inside uterus. To become pregnant, penetrative sexual intercourse with or without ejaculation during fertile period of cycle is required. Use condom in future to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, Chat Doctor. Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed. Best regards,

input: hi, I am 18 years old, 140 lbs. On monday I had the roots of my dental implants done, and it pains me to wear the retainer. everyday I try to put the retainer in hoping that it won t hurt and i ll be able to leave it on. But the pain hasn t faded and I m worried my teeth will shift. What should I do?
output: Hello, It's not a good sign to have pain after getting an implant in our jaw. The pain can occur for a day or two but if it is prolonged it could be a sign of infection. However in your case, you mentioned you wear retainers- that is one of the possible cause of pain. You are not supposed to wear retainers for at least two weeks till the gums over the implant heal well. Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a "soft tissue liners" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it's not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase. Avoid for two weeks and consult your dentist. Let him do a clinical examination and take an x-ray of the area. Be cautious if you see "pus" coming out. that's a sign of infection. Must go back to your dentist and talk. Good luck.

output: Hello, Firstly, let me tell you that you have misused the emergency pill and put it into too much use. An emergency pill is meant to be used only a couple of times a year; else, it can lead to catastrophic patterns of menstruation. Since you have attained menstruation which was indeed a with Chat Doctor.  Emergency contraception can be of use only when used soon after an intercourse and not at any part of the cycle.

In the future, please go for some form of regular contraception and do not use emergency pills so frequently. Hope this helps.

output: Dear Mrs, There is a little possibility that your medication can cause high blood pressure. Sometimes they can cause high blood pressure in the beginning of the treatment but blood pressure normalizes after some time. So, don't panic. If blood pressure is not more than 150/90, try lifestyle changes for 3 months, cut the amount of salt intake and exercise regularly. Take care

input: I have a blister on my nipple. I am 19 weeks pregnant. Before pregnancy I had black discharge coming out of this nipple as well. The doctor did an ultrasound on my breast (before I was pregnant) and said he had no concerns at the time. Now that I m pregnant I am still getting black discharge and I now have what seems like a blister right beside my nipple. What should I do?
output: Hi. Blisters on the nipples or around them (in the areolar region), most commonly occur due to 2 reasons, either due to friction (from clothing, sexual activity, etc.; or what we call a milk blister which occurs while breastfeeding. As for the black nipple discharge, this could be associated with a hematoma in the breast, an abscess, etc.; and will require more concrete investigations into finding the cause as you will soon have to breastfeed. Best wishes.

input: i am treated for minimal PTB f 3 years ago, nom im apllying for a working visa ni saudi Arabia, before undergoing for the medical exam of an agency, i went to the see a pulmonologist and have xrayed, the result is just a scar on my lungs..would i pass the medical exam? how will i get rid of the scar?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. To have lung scars after treatment of tuberculosis is normal healing phenomenon. These scars are inactive, harmless, noninfectious lesions. So no treatment is required for this and no treatment is available today remove them. But for visa clearance, we need to prove that these lesions are not active and infectious. For this, you need to get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT is more superior in diagnosis of scar lesion as compare to chest x-ray. If both these are negative for active infection, you can argue with visa authority that these lesions are old, healed, scarred lesions and not active, infectious lesions. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

So check yourself for pat-ency of your tubes either by laparoscopy or though Hysto-salphingogram. If it is cleared you'll become a mother. Good luck.  Chat Doctor.

Is it safe to switch to Tramadol?Thank You,Mary

input: Hi, Im 17 and when my scrotum is loose it looks a bit too wrinkly for my age. I actually havent compared this with anyone else so Im not too sure. When it is tight during colder times it looks somewhat smooth, some wrinkles here and there but overall it looks ok.

input: My son scratched his eye this evening, took him to the doctor and they said he was fine. Got about home and he started terribly crying that his head hurt. When he got home, he threw up twice and now is fine. What should I do, what is going on with him?
output: HI...it could be a viral illness responsible for all this. I suggest you give him Paracetamol for headache. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. But if the vomiting persists or if he is behaving weirdly or is excessively sleepy, then I suggest you get back to the doctor or nearest emergency room. Regards - 

input: hi, I have always had pain around my right side carotid artery, under my jaw, radiate to my ear, and my shoulders.  Sometime i feel it is on the side of my throat.  It is wearing me out, my memory is geting weaker and weaker, sometime i feel as if everything blocked as it affect my proper breathing and i dont feel i am relaxed...i am 49 by the way and i had this for few years now ... but it is geting worse and causing me to be rigid and stiff... can u tell me plz what i should do and what could be the diagnosis and what kind of doctors i should visit...  thx..  MK
output: Hello MK! I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to a temporomandibular joint dysfunction or a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, causing articular nerve pain in this region. For this reason, I would recommend performing a cervical spine MRI study. If this test results normal, I would recommend consulting with the ENT specialist for a physical exam of the temporomandibular junction. Anxiety could also play an important role on all this clinical scenario, too. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, 

input: Hi, I recently had a scheduled angioplasy and two stents implanted. I had a followup visit this week with the cardiologist. He informed me that he implanted an expired stent. This is a Taxis drug illuding stent. Is this against FDA regulations to implant an expired stent in a patient? I believe there must be strict FDA regulations in doing so? Tom J
output: Hi, Using expired stent is against the law and illegal. There is a shelf life for every product in medicine beyond which its use is not recommended. You should have got the cover boxes of the stents, and you can see it yourself whether they were expired at the time of placement. If they were expired, you can file a legal lawsuit on the doctor and hospital. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: All that I can convey to you on the basis of my three decades old clinical experience is that you must get support of Ayurveda treatment. While surgery can remove nodules, it cannot prevent regrowing. Here Ayurveda can help you in a safe n side effect less way.Similarly, anti Pittman regime in Ayurveda can effectively manage allergic conditions and common herbs can be used to ad Chat Doctor. No interaction of any Ayurveda med. With any other 

input: For the past two months i ve had some tingling/parasthesia in my right hand and a visible radial pulse. The parasthesia has waned over time but still occurs each day especially when i m in a relaxed seated postition. I m a little worried that there is compression somewhere that is causing this visible sign and tingling.
output: Hello, It may be due to nerve compression.  For further assessment, you may require MRI neck, nerve conduction studies after spine surgeon consultation. For pain, you can take tablet acetaminophen. You may require tablet Pregabalin and multivitamin tablets after consultation. Do regular physical therapy. Hope I have answered your query.

input: Had 2 stones in Left kidney 5 x 7 x 8. Used lots of water and lemons and potassium citrate etc. for 1.3 months and they dont show up on 2nd ultrasound any longer. Still have what doc thinks is severe ureter spasming and he ordered a CT today to see if any pieces are left in ureter.  He said that even if nothing is found the irritation can continue for weeks before both ureters calm down.  It hurts to evacuate in morning.  He said that the irritated ureter can irritate the bowel but Im not understanding that?  How does that happen?  Have never has any bowel issues at all.  No diahhrea currently at all or IBS symptoms.  Cant eat alot because when full and food moving downward the 2 lines going down become tight and sore.  Can it take this long for the ureters to calm down?  Having CT scan later today. Thanks.
output: Hi.you had renal stones, probably it has come out with HY Chat Doctor. . Since it has not shown up in the earlier CT scan.you have sore throat, it is a completely different issue. You have acute pharyngitis, probably due to water infection.see you ENT surgeon for this, for examination.and you need to start with antibiotics, analgesics, salt water gargling would help.your ureteric colic will be diagnosed with the scheduled ct scan today.see your urologist with the report for the further management.bye.

input: I am 5 months pregnant and suddenly 2 months ago I developed genital warts. My doctor said he cant do anything while am pregnant. Are there any medications especially home remedies to get rid of the warts before i give birth besides surgery or freezing
output: I suggest you not to undergo any surgery or any minor or major procedures on your body unless or otherwise its necessary . Because during pregnancy your immune system is suppressed.  So as a result your healing capacity will be low and chances of getting infected is high.  And on the period of your pregnancy most of the Chat Doctor.  I personally would not suggest you to undergo the procedure.

input: Hi, my name is Gary I was diagnoses and had colon cancer stage 4 and spread to liver. I had treatment 5 weeks for radiation, and  total 6 times chemo. It seem like first 3 times chemo therapy is not working so my doctor change to different chemo medicine, is seem like cancer wont spread and shrunk. by that time i met some one and he recommend me to change my diet, drink more water, no sugar, so when i went to draw blood my CEA went up from 24 to 30 and after i change my diet and last 3 chemo my CEA back down to 13 and my doctor told me i have to do one more chemo. And i decided not to do because a lot of people told me radiation and chemo kill people more than cancer kill people. So i went back to draw blood and check with my doctor my CEA go back up to 26.     I would like to know am i do the right thing? just only change my diet and not listen what my doctor tell me what to do??? right now i feel just like normal person, i can go to exercise, running, walking, but i lot some weight  because i eat only fish, vegetable, and fruit.would you please, answer me what am i suppose to do?? Thank you so muchGary
output: Hi, I went through your query. I am afraid changing your diet at this stage will not cure your cancer. Colon cancer mainly occurs due to a high fat diet. Dietary fiber as in fruits and vegetables has a protective role. However once you have the cancer it does not help much. It is true that chemotherapy and radiation have very serious side effects and can themselves cause cancer. But at stage 4 that is the best possible treatment available. I would advise you to continue with your treatment. But you can talk to your doctor if you do not wish it and ask him/her for some other palliative treatment. Hope this helps.

input: my son has really foul smelling stools. What could be the issue besides possibly lactose intolerance & celiac disease? He is 7 years old. He had a upper GI endoscopy done a few years ago and at that time he was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and they also mentioned that he had lower than average lactase levels. His dairy intake is not excessive. He has a glass of milk in the morning or afternoon and occasionally pizza. I m concerned because although he has no other symptoms such as stomach discomfort or gas or bloating, his stools are really malodorous to the point where we have to have him change his underwear and shorts often for no other apparent reason. Please advise. Thank you!
output: The foul smelling stools could be due to overgrowth of certain bacteria in his intestines. A course of metronidazole thrice daily for 5 days should be helpful. Also give him plenty of curd. You may skip the glass of milk in the morning and give other nutritive food items instead. The primary manifestation of lactose intolerance would be bloating and abdominal distention which your child does not have. In case of celiac disease, failure to grow properly and frequency of stool are generally present.

input: hi sir, i got pain in lower back. i feel it is in middle of hip and lower back. actually i am feeling the pain 3 days back onwards. And it started paining when i woke up in the morning 3 days back. i have used one of the spray but no relief. Used some myospaz and aceclo but no relief. Not able to understand what could be the reason and how to avaoid this.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor After going through your query I think You are suffering from acute backache. Treatment of it is rest and analgesics. Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective. Sometimes strong analgesic(such as attract three times a day after meals) is required. OMEPRAZOLE before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. You can discuss with your treating Doctor. To father investigate MRI of the region is advised. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link:https://www.bit.ly/ask Chat Doctor. Take care.

input: My daughter will be 15 years old on the 22nd. On Feb 21, she had a grand mal seizure. She has never had a seizure before that date. However, over the past year and a half, she has had sudden jerking motions in her arms and head. She was on med for Primary inattentive disorder (ADD) and her doctor was aware of these movements but did not testing. Right before she had the seizure the jerking movements with her arms were worse then they have ever been especially in her left are. Could this have been some type of seizure all along. Her neurologist had me take her for an eeg but ordered no lab work or anything else. I have called the neurologist many times because I am concerned about what I need to do for my daughter and she has never returned my calls. Her PA left a message on my phone saying the EEG was normal and I have heard nothing else from them. I am an RN and I know more tests should have been ordered. I plan to take her to a different neurologist. What is your opinion.
output: Symptoms described by you're suggestive of JME (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). In such cases MRI will be normal. If EEG is normal...then repeat EEG study after sleep deprivation. We can start TAB valproate. Prognosis is very good in this epilepsy.regards.

input: Hi , My Wife is detected with cervical Lymph node TB. She has been put on R-Cinex 600  1 tab daily, Pyzina 750 mg 2 tabs daily, mycobutol 1000 1.5 tabs daily and benadon 40 1 tab daily..she is having violent shivering with fever (~ 103 degree centrigrade), joint pains etc after 1 hour of taking Pyzina 750 mg 2 tabs daily, mycobutol 1000 1.5 tabs daily and benadon 40 1 tab daily..any suggestions ?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Patina is having pyrazinamide. Mycobutol is having ethambutol. Both of them can cause rise in uric acid level (hyperglycemia). This high uric acid can accumulate in joints and cause joint pain. It can also cause fever with chills. So in my opinion, she should get done uric acid level and if it is raised then she needs to take Eurostat tablet. Eurostat is having property of reduced uric acid production. So consult her doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your wife. Thanks.

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. If connective disease is ruled out and since your CT chest are normal as told by you, no need to worry about lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) with lung volumes and DCO. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Now since rashes are not your problem and cough I'd only issue now it should felt with. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Son is 9 years old 67lbs and 53inches. He has had an inflamed testicle for a month. It started to burn when he urinated 3 weeks ago. He saw a urologist for 5 minutes who said it was a virus that could last a year. We are to go back in four months if there is blood in his urine or if it still burns alot when he pees. His urine test from 3 weeks ago came back negative for a uti. There has been no blood work or a repeat urine test. He cries everyday that it burns bad when he pees.
output: Hello, I suggest that his Urine RM teat to be related and also a USG and Doppler of affected testes to be done.

input: I have a sore bump on my gums that makes it difficult for me to put in my implant dentures.  What is an over-the-counter drug I can use to reduce this bump and relieve the pain?  I have been duding salt rinses, using listering and the rinse my dentist gave me without results.  Please help!!
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bump on the gums could be because of gum infection secondary to chronic irritation by the denture. Consult an oral physician to rule out whether it is a gum infection or an over growth of the tissue. If it is infection you can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. If it is a growth then it has to be surgically removed. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

I had given metalyes IV 80 cc . Today I made ECG=anterior ISCH changes recent. ECHO = (( EF= 40-45%. + anterior apical akinesia )). Please is it danger ?! Do I need cath ? With regard. Thank you My name is Fares Al masa eyed.

input: I had xrays of my lower back recently and the following was part of the report. I don t really understand any of this. Can you please help me understand. There is a curvilinear opacity overlaying the left upper quadrant seen only in the AP projection. While pathological calcification within the abdomen cannnot be excluded, this appearance is new from the prior study, decreasing the likelihood that this is a significant finding. This could reflect overlying artifact or bowel contents. A punctate opacity overlying the superior pole of the right kidney on the current view was noted to be projected more superiorly on the prior study and is likely a hepatic granuloma. Impression: Curvilinear opacity over the left upper quadrant of the abdomen is likely artifactual. A repeat abdominal radiograph is recommended and CT would be indicated if this opacity persists.
output: Dear sir /madam I would like to know why was the radiograph taken, As for the reporting seems like there is an incidental finding, I would like to know more about the clinical history and also like to know other finding in the radiograph Some incidental findings could be artifacts. So before jumping into conclusions I would suggest talking to your primary clinician about your primary illness and then decide about this incidental finding

input: im constantly horny and when i dont get laid coz my girlfriend doesnt want to do it or doesnt want to do it quick i feel like end of the world, I know this is not normal :( and is there way to get rid of that feeling somehow...p.s. i masturbate everyday 2-3 times even when i get laid...
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. You have not given your age here. Please understand that sex is not essential for human being. That is just another emotion where body and mind gets pleasure feeling rather than pain. Your frustration is understandable. You are denied of sexual pleasure, and then you are irritated. What happens if you desire sexual pleasure from someone you don't know? What happens if you don't get it from them? You are expecting your girlfriend to behave according to your wish and when she disagrees you are disappointed. What is wrong in that? How can you call yourself horny on that aspect? Masturbation once per day for teenagers and thrice or four times a week for adults are OK. Once you get married, your masturbation stops. When you get a job your masturbation reduces. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: one week ago I felt my chest constricted, but thought that it was due to adding some free weights to my regimen.  Today, Im feeling some slight constrictions, my pulse is 94, and Ive felt some light constrictions in my neck, just behind my ear...what do you think?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart related diseases in your case because chest constriction, neck pain and high pulse rate (94). All these favor heart diseases more. So consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes muscular spasm cannot also cause constriction feeling. So take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. But better to first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: hello doctor, i am 21 year old female. i noticed undigested rice in my stool today and undigested food for past 10 days. i am taking clarithromycin from 3 days because i am told to as i have folliculitis. what could possibly cause this condition and is there any treatment?
output: Thanks for posting you query to Chat Doctor.there is no relation of folliculitis with indigestion as folliculitis is infection of hair follicle and not associated with indigestion, so I am not understanding the purpose of taking Azithromycin. If you are having any painful lesion of hair follicle then let me know so that I can suggest you correct remedy as Staphylococcus is the most common organism to causing it. Indigestion could be due to some other cause alteration in your daily food intake or timing of meal may cause such problem .for your digestive problem you should presently start to take plenty of water per day and increase green veg in your date. Take Sachet or capsule of gut flora :DAR OLAC" once in day to maintain normal gut environment.presently no need for antibiotic. Hope you are satisfied with my answer.  Feel free to communicate if any query.regards, Chat Doctor.

input: My husband is presenting with pneumonia and a terrible cough, producing yellow phlegm and or clear liquid water like substance. He has finished 10 days of antibiotics, currently 6 days post antibiotics. He still has cough, phlegm, and now has blurred vision in both eyes. He is otherwise a healthy 53 year old.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Ideal treatment of pneumonia is to first isolate the organism a dthan start antibiotic according to the sensitivity pattern. So in your husbands' case I advise you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. Repeat chest x ray2. Sputum culture and sensitivity3. Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. Since after 6 days of antibiotics, he is not improving, so we need chest x-ray to determine whether pneumonia is worsened or not. Sputum culture is necessary to isolate the causative organism and sensitivity is needed to guide antibiotic therapy. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Avoid haphazard use of antibiotics in pneumonia as it will cause Chat Doctor.

input: Dear Dr My Father had a bye pass surgery on 19th November 2010. Dr had advised to have Glycomet GP 2 for future. But due to having a very low sugar our doctor changed the medicine to Glycomet GP 1. The sugar level became normal for few days which was around 125-145. but since few days his sugar is again keeping low - Jan 17, 2012 at 9 pm sugar level- 74 Jan 18, 2012 at 9.30 am after tea sugar level- 164 Jan 18,2012 at 9.45 pm sugar level-84 doctor please advise in this matter and do let us know any good diebetician in dehradun whom we can consult. Waiting for your response. Regards,Upasana
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that 74 is not a very low level of sugar. Anyway, if he feels symptoms like dizziness, fatigue and sweating, this could be a sign that his body does not tolerate these low levels of glucose. I would recommend reducing the dose of Glycogen GP in order to have higher levels of glucose. You should know that all oral antidiabetics can lead to hypoglycemia as a common adverse effect. That is why the dose should be adjusted based on the fasting glucose levels during the day. You should discuss with his endocrinologist about the above issues. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards,

output: Hi, Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Once the course of antibiotics is over you can get this IRENA removed. And kindly make sure the whole infection is cleared before the new IRENA is inserted. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

input: I am experiencing right abdominal pain and pain in my right groin area.  I have had liver panel, blood tests all came back okay.  Had abdominal CT Scan and no problems with internal organs detected.  Will schedule colonoscopy within days.  But the doc doesnt have a clue whats causing the pain
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Read the history and understood your problem. Pain in the right abdomen and the right groin can be due to:-Ureteric stones and UTI.-Appendicitis.-Any problem with the thoracolumbar spine can have referred pain like this. Since your CT scan and liver tests are normal, many of the problems that can be detected by the CT scan are ruled out. -let us wait for the colonoscopy reports.

input: For about two years I ve had this painful lump inside my anal and for a few months I ve had it in my vagina to. It is very painful and the past month has become worse and sometimes is unbearable and had more lumps turn up on my vagina. I am not sexually active so the problems couldn t be caused by that and I m only 18 so the changes of me having colon cancer is low? what could it be? I went to the doctor to have blood tests hoping that something would come back wrong so she would find out about the lumps but they came back perfect. I haven t seen a doctor about the lumps I ve just been trying to deal with the pain than find out it s something bad. I m embarrassed to tell my GP and get an exam, I don t even know what to tell her. I was attacked 5 months ago and I m even more afraid of seeing a doctor or letting anyone close to me than I was before the fear is ridiculous and is stopping me from getting help. Sometimes the pain makes me want to commit suicide I don t know what to do anymore

I am supposed to have it surgically removed but cant afford it right now (it swelled up to the size of a golf ball before the drainage and took over a month to stop draining!).
output: Hello, The sting sensation could be related to an infection.

You may need to Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. No need to worry because minor variation is not significant in RBC counts and Platelet counts. Monocytes counts can also slightly high.

input: hi doc, can you explain the chest pa result of my mother having the following remarks:The heart appears to be slightly enlarge with left ventricular prominence.The aorta is calcified.Both lungs are clear with normal bronchovascular pattern. The rest of the visualized chest structures are unremarkable. pls doc, i need to know if it is manageable or need for her to undergo hospital admisison? i will be very happy if you can response to my inquiry..thank you. truly yours, aileen m.
output: This result is not too concerning. They describe a slightly enlarged chamber of the heart, which occurs over many years. She can have her heart evaluated by an echocardiogram (ultrasound). Calcification of the aorta refers to build up of plaque in the big artery that comes out of the heart. This happens with age and is not acutely concerning.

Do I need to go back to the doctor ?
output: Hi. Red colored rash like spots may be seen in some viral fevers. They go away once the fever reduces. If these rashes/spots do not go away once the fever reduces or if these spots increases then you may have to put it across to the doctor. Hope it is just due to a minor viral illness.

On consultation with local doctor, the medicine has been changed to Telminorm 80 mg. Further she is diabetic since 1987 and is on insulin since last two years. The regular tests has shown that it is under control. The present reading is Fasting - 60 and PP is 114.

input: When I go to the doctor, I have a blood pressure reading of 150/90 with a pulse of 60.When I take my pressure here at home, I mostly stabilize between 130-140 and 80-85.The day before yesterday, I had a reading of 134/77 with a pulse of 58.I am taking Diovan 320mg and am 76 years old and in very good physical health.Should I be concerned about these BP differences between home and doctors office?
output: Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorNothing to worry about the BP differences between home and doctor's office. This is an entity called White coat hypertension. Blood pressure readings will be 10-20 MMH more when you visit the doctors' clinic, because of increased anxiety levels when meeting a doctor. I would advise you to continue your medications and be relaxed. Hope I have cleared your doubts. Thank you.

input: I had gall bladder surgery two weeks ago. I was fine for five days and then I had an attach like I was having a heart attach, went to the hospital and given nitro and it put my heart rate over 140 and my blood pressure went high. They gave me a bunch of drugs to get rid of the symptoms, but the next morning I felt like my nerves where jumping out of my body. I have not been able to stop shaking since. I shake really bad and I m very nauseated. Any ideas on what is causing this. My doctors can t seem to help me.
output: Hello, This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour HOLDER monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation.  Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated, as it can also be a panic attack. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day.  If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiologist studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.

input: Yes, hello My 2 years old son, last night went to the hospital after a fall and he got stiches on his chin, and two on the inside of his bottom lip.  Today on the inside of the lips I see some kind of yellow substance, and the lip is swollen.  Can it be infected?
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Yes, it can be infected. Swelling is often a sign of infection, especially when it is accompanied by too much reddening of the skin. Marked tenderness and a burning sensation, pus and fever are also signs of infection. So if these signs and symptoms are present then you should consult a doctor. You can give ARN ICA 30, one dose daily for 3 days,it is a homoeopatChatDoctoredicine which is very good after trauma and helps in prevention of infection and early healing. You should consult a doctor and get the wound rechecked. Hope this will help. Take disregards Chat Doctor.

It did this a couple of years ago and I had to get it lanced and drained for three weeks.......it was awful and painful.  What can I do this time?

input: i think i had sex with a guy who has a type of genital wart but im not sure, i asked him and he wont say but many other people told me otherwise, he no longer will talk to me. i have these small hard pimple size bumps in my mouth for over a year. they are the same color as the rest of my mouth mainly, but at the tip of the bump it is slightly lighter i think its because the skin is pulled tighter at the tip of the round bump then the bottom. i have one under my tongue , not on my tongue but between the spit ducks, one on my gums on the inside of my bottom jaw, about half an inch down from my teeth sightly to the right and one on my gums on the outside upper jaw above my two front teeth on that piece of skin and gum line that attaches my lip to my gums. on my lips in the corner of my mouth when i pull the skin tight i see and feel tiny hard white bumps. some are touching some have an mm. or two mm. between them but they are close. i have not tried to pop them, im to scared to. i also have this ruff patch on my gums on my outer front jaw. i can scrape this white plaque off the ruff patch and when i do i can see it patch better, it kinda looks like some bumps but its hard to tell. i am 20 and i am a little over weight 188lb, i have smoked for six years now. and i also think i have other stuff going on down stairs but im not sure i really dont know much about anything down there.

output: If you have to be on medicines for pain, it calls for that you have a change of nature of work as lifting weights and patients would be an impediment to healing. Get your spine thoroughly examined and screened by spine specialist and if he recommends change of occupation/nature of work to lighter work then it may be confirmed from radiological evidence

input: I woke up this morning to take my little brother to school and felt fine. I came back and went back to sleep for about three more hours and I woke up with a severe back pain that I feel when I move. It also affects my breathing, every time I feel the pain I get a reaction of holding my breath and flexing my stomach. Most of the pain come from the right middle area of my back within my ribs, but it inflicts my whole back. Not to long ago I tried sleeping but my stomach cramped up pretty bad almost like someone was squeezing it. Anyways I m awake wondering if this is something temporary maybe because I slept wrong. Or can it be something severe which I doubt because like I said when I took my brother to school I felt perfectly fine.

Since the pain is associated with deep breathing and there is no history of injury in the area, lung causes like pneumonia and pulmonary embolism need to be ruled out after proper investigations.

Ive been eating soft foods so that I dont accidentally bite it. Any ideas of how to get rid of it?
output: Hello, Thanks for consulting ChatDoctorRead your query as you have painful bump behind upper front teeth this can be due to thermal burn, or dental infection might be carious or periodontal infection like periodontal abscess. For this I will suggest you to consult oral surgeon for examination and in meantime you can apply ointment like Mugel or McCoppin on bump. Hope this will help you.

input: Thanks. 2010 I was told by my son s pediatrician that the muscles in his legs were breaking down ...enzymes? He couldn t shake a flu like occurrence that started Feb of that year and he was complaining of weakness through March. I can t recall the diagnosis. Any direction is appreciated. I can call the doc s office in the am and obtain the data if I have not provided enough data. Thanks again
output: What I can collect from your post is that your child is suffered from weakness and recently having prolonged fever. He might be suffering from Myositis or other congenital disease associated with weakness. I can't help you without the investigation workup that already you have done. Kindly post it to me. In many of the cases there are definite treatments which should be started as early as possible to get the best results. Thank you.

input: Hello, my 47 year old boyfriend said the doctor found a hole in his heart that is one eighth in size. His doctor recommened he see a radiologist for x-rays and a MRI of his heart because of years of very high, uncontrolled blood pressure. On the day of the appointment he was short of breath, weak, sweating, and his blood sugar dropped. He is also a type 2 diabetic. His doctor told him that surgery might be needed depending on the MRI results. My boyfriend is also a recovery addict of cocaine and heroin. Do you think the drugs played any role in this or made the hole become bigger? Is a hole of that size considered big? Does he have a higher risk of heart attack or heart failure? And do you think surgury is needed and if so, what kind? Lastly, why was this detected now, so late in life? Thank- you for your response.
output: Hello, After going through your medical query I understand your concern and would like to tell you that if he has a hole in the heart then surgery is recommended to prevent fury cardiac deterioration. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hello and Welcome to Chat Doctor, Thanks for writing to us. Vitamin E, known for its healing qualities, helps nourish skin and fade scars. Open a vitamin E capsule and apply gel directly to the scars twice a day until you see them start to fade, then apply once a day thereafter. Eat foods rich in vitamin K. These are good for your skin because vitamin K helps heal and protect skin from wounds and scars. Slice a fresh lemon and brush across your chicken-pox scars. Coat chicken-pox scars liberally in honey once a day. Rub raw garlic on your chicken-pox scars at night. If your scars are new, rub sandalwood oil on them. Do this for a few months, and you just might prevent your scar from setting in the first place. If your scars are very old, rub coconut oil on them every morning. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards.

Report to your treating doctor too to know whether any of medicines you are on is causing side effects

He sent me to get a port study and the result was the nurses had not been putting the needles in correctly and the chemo has been leaking out around the port causing severe large burn on my chest . They will be removing this port as soon as it heals, but can you tell me how this could damage the inside of my body?

output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The history and symptoms suggests me that you are having some food allergy, these allergens will stimulate the mast cell to release histamine which is producing all these symptoms. I would suggest you to undergo skin prick test (SPT) for different most prevalent food allergens to identify the food causing these symptoms. By doing to this it is possible to identify the allergen, by doing this you can avoid the food causing these symptoms, if it is not possible to avoid the food you can go for immunotherapy either with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) or subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT). Thank you.

input: im 25 yrs old i did unprotected sex with ny boy friend on 4th of april i took birth control pill on 5th of april and also did pregancy test it was negative than i did another test on 11th april it was also negative than again we did sex on 18th april and again i took birth control pill i have some early symptoms of early pregnancy but i dont knw its a sign that im pregnant or these are the side effects of the birth cobtrol pill.if im am pregnant i dont want this baby plz help me and suggest me a abortion pill
output: Hi dear user, thanks for your query. You have not mentioned anything about your menstrual cycles. Pregnancy test cannot be positive just after having intercourse. Also, morning pills are protective in 75% cases. So, I cannot rule out pregnancy in your case. In my opinion, first, you get a serum beta Chat Doctor test done to diagnose pregnancy only if you have missed your period and, if it comes out to be positive then, one ultrasound to see gestation and location of pregnancy. Only after that, you should think of abortion. Hope this helps.

input: I have 10 months old child when he was for day old he had fits and then after four months again he suffered from fits. but not he taking treatment with a neuroligist but still today he didnt have one. But he is moving his hand and legs very well but still not started to crawl. When we make him stnd he keeps on jumping and climbing up. Is there any problem
output: No not at all. Crawling usually started on 3 -6 months of age. At 6 month babies are usually sitting on the floor without any support and around 10 months of age they try to stand and walk with some support. According to your history the baby shows appropriate developmental stage. So do not worry. Fits may be due to febrile convulsions which may not need any treatment and usually resolve after 5 year of age.(But history is not sufficient to tell whether it is febrile convulsions)

input: I am a 32 year old woman having bulky uterus and endometrial thickness. I have been suffering in irregular and heavy menstruation for more than 15 years. I want to get relief from this.I have a 2.4 years old son, if I wish to conceive now, is there any problem?pls advice me .
output: Hi, Thanks for the query. Better to go for dilatation and curettage once with your doctors' advice. This helps for diagnostic purpose, to obtain the tissue for histopathological examination. And for therapeutic purpose. By doing D&C heavy bleeding can be decreased in next cycles. If the histopathological examination shows normal tissue, no need to worry. Once check for hormonal profile and thyroid profile. If you are having regular ovulation, there may not be any problem in getting pregnancy. Track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. If hormonal profile is somewhat abnormal, you may need support of hormones in the early pregnancy. Take care.

input: i am getting my follicular ultrasound done today...i am 23 and trying to concieve for the past 4 months..i have regular periods..and i am on my 13th day of the cycle today..we had sex yesterday..will a follicular study today reveal if i have concieved today ?
output: Hi, A follicular study shows the development of the egg in the follicle, and can indicate the size of the follicle and can identify when the follicle ruptures. It cannot say if fertilization has occurred or not. Have you taken ovulation induction as well? If you have been trying for 4 months only, I would advise you to wait for 1 year, as most couples(85%) conceive in a years time on their own. The remaining need to be evaluated for the cause and then treated. The most likely period to conceive is 36 hours after the follicle ruptures. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: Blood sugar has been high for several days now. Today it keeps going up again. It is now at 356. I have also been peeing ALOT and very thirsty last couple of days. Should I adress this or wait to see if it levels out. Also I am on Metfromin 500mg twice a day.
output: Hello dear user! I have gone through your query and understood your concerns! Thank you for sharing them on Chat Doctor. Such levels of blood sugar, excessive urination and thirst you are experiencing lately indicate an uncontrolled diabetes. Unfortunately metformin you are taking seems to be unable to control blood sugar by itself. You will need a combination of Chat Doctor.  I would recommend you to contact your endocrinologist as soon as possible to help you get the proper cure and lower the sugar level. Don't stay at home waiting if it levels out. It won't. I hope this answer was helpful to you! Please kindly rate it as helpful and write a short review about your experience with me! I would appreciate that a lot. Thank you and best regards!

input: I recently had some blood tests done and found I had a high enzyme level on my liver . The doctor put this down to heavy drinking over the festive period and asked me to book in for a secondary set of blood tests in order to confirm this and hopefully see the levels drop and asked me to stop drinking. I have now had my second set of blood tests results which indicate high ESR levels but they were ok in the first set of tests? Since my first set of tests I have gone back to the gym and lifting heavy weights as well as having a large volume of protein shakes in and between gym sessions. Could this be a reason for a high/abnormal ESR levels?

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...hi Im 18 and I have a question about pregnancy. my LMP was july 21st and I havent gotten my period since then. I have a lot of cramps like if my periods about to come but it doesnt. and sometimes my breasts hurt but for 5 seconds and then it goes away. also I feel like Im leaking from down there and I think its my period but its nothing. Ive also taken hpts several times but they all come back negative. also I get like a tingling sensation around my belly button. could I be pregnant?
output: Hello dear, I understand your concern. The first sign of pregnancy is missed period. And to confirm a urine pregnancy test need to be done a week after missed period for accurate results. The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period. The fetal movements start around 5 months of pregnancy. The chance of pregnancy appears less with your symptoms but confirmation need to be done by urine pregnancy test. If the test is negative there is no chance of pregnancy. So relax. Avoid stress because stress also causes hormonal imbalance and delays the period. Best regards...

input: Hello my daughter fell in the shower the other day and hit her head she seemed fine just a little sore now she has a fever stomach and crusty swollen eyes when she wakes up that are blood shot she also went swimming in lake Erie about a week ago Im not sure why she is sick like this.
output: Hello, The blood shot eyes with crusting is because of the conjunctivitis I presume which she contracted in the swimming pool. Swimming pools infections need a thorough investigation by a competent ophthalmologist. I suggest you please consult one soon. Avoid self medications. The fever might not be related to the conjunctivitis. Though it is not rare to have both together but considering the situation I suggest you to get the eyes examined first.

output: Hello, You are a male for sure because you are able to do masturbation using your own penis. You have a length of 4 inches on the erection and that is a good size. Don't worry too much about it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: My son is 10 years old and he is having 2nd molar coming out. He is experiencing terrible pain since past one month. In between he had some cold , fever. He took medicines and now complaining about wrist and joint pain in both hands. Can you please tell us why is it so ? Can it be because of new molar coming out ? His blood test report for Rheumatic Arthritis and Rheumatic fever is negative....... please help
output: Good evening, the wrist and joint pains is unlikely because of arthritis or coming of molar. Some fevers also cause joint pains. However, if the fever has subsided and still the child is having pain it could also be because of calcium or vitamin D deficiency. A blood test for Serum Calcium/ Ionic calcium and vitamin D levels should be ideally done and started on appropriate supplements. X-ray of the involved joints can be done to support the diagnosis.

input: I had a tetanus shot about 3 days ago and now I have a very sore small lump in my neck near my collar bone, is this normal? The only reason Im concerned is I just had a c-section and Im worried about blood clots. I did not notice this lump before the shot, so I dont think it is a clot but I thought I would check.
output: Hi, Reviewed your query.Don't worry, as by no means the sore lump near collar bone would occur due to clot after the tetanus shot in the arm. This lump seems mostly due to the general immune reaction with flare up of the lymph node near the collar bone. Still I would advise you to have a check-up from your doctor to get the worry ruled out. Hope this would relive your query satisfactorily. Write excellent review and hit thanks if this has helped to resolve your issue. Welcome again further for any query in this regard. Have a good day. Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist. S.

input: I am a 22 year old male and I work aboard cruise ships.  In order to be approved for work, I must undergo a full medical exam.  18-19 months ago when I took my exam, they came back with high levels of SGOT and SGPT and absolute monocytes.  After taking the test over again, all numbers where back to normal.  The doctor while unsure what caused it, suggested perhaps the intense work out I had done the night before the initial tests caused the numbers to go up. Two weeks ago I had to undergo the same full medical exam to go back to my new ship, and this time the SGOT and SGPT came back high again. SGOT at 191 and SGPT at 97.  I did have drinks the night before the tests but I still would like to know if I should be concerned.
output: Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Previously when liver enzymes high yes it can be by myositis or muscular problem by too much work load.... But again this time enzymes level high, and you have history of alcohol.... So investigate your case with USG first to rule out fatty liver.... It will also reveal gall stone like condition if present....HIDE scan also seems to be helpful.... Alcohol also is the causative factor... So try to avoid over Chat Doctor. .... If still needed viral marker study done to rule out chronic carrier case....Meanwhile, take low fat diet.... Fruits more.... If still cause not clear detail history taken with subsequent investigation for detail work up... And if doctor needed even biopsy might be done for advance investigation ... Take care.

input: First off I do have hpv.... I had sex with someone new and a few days later noticed my lymph nodes in my groin were sore. No discharge nothing else just swollen nodes for a week now. Today I noticed the fluid filled blisters under the head. Is this my hpv acting up?
output: Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. In my opinion it is not an HPV.HPV never causes fluid filled blister and lymph nodes. It is other STD. Definitive diagnosis can be possible only after Grams staining from blister fluid followed by microscopic examination. You can wear condom during sex. This will prevent further transmission of infection. You can take the simultaneous treatment of HPV and other STD. Treatment for both the partner is necessary to prevent cross infection. I will be happy to answer your further concern, you can ask me on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.  Thank you. ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist.

input: I think I had an allergic reaction to something...possibly some tea I was drinking. My symptoms are flu light: mild fever, body aches, joint pain, sore throat, blisters on extremities, and pain on fingertips. Do these symptoms resemble some other issue?

output: Viral disease leads to these symptoms. These are self limiting symptoms. You need to take plenty of oral fluids, symptomatic treatment for fever and all.

input: I was diagnosed with stage 0-1 November 2012--first time was November 1998--same breast--lumpectomy Jan 1999.  Double mastectomy Jan 2013--reconstructive surgery finished for now--no knowledge of any current cancer.  Took 1 mg of anastrozole Jan 2013 to Nov 2013--severe burning in uretha and vulva--switched to tamoxifen 20 mg--no relief--switched to 10 mg--still burning--off all cancer medicine now for a week.  Burning is much subsided --still a little discomfort sometimes--now what?
output: It is not all common to have burning sensation in urethra with anastrazole. You have not written whether you were investigated for other causes of burning sensation like infection. You have also not mentioned your age, since postmenopausal status can cause Chat Doctor.  Stopping medication is not advisable since you had malignancy twice. Find out the cause clearly before stopping the medicine

input: Hello, If you are an orthodontist, please help. I have been wearing retainers for almost a year. Nonstop aside from when I eat. My last visit, I was advised to wear them only at night. I noticed significant change 2 weeks later after doing so. My teeth kept shifting. So I switched to wearing them all the time again. The shifting doesnt stop. Did I mess up?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Orthodontic Retainers are advised to maintain the changed teeth position after achieving proper alignment of teeth post completion of orthodontic treatment. But in case if the teeth movement has started occurring and not being controlled even after increasing the time duration of wearing retainers, there is a possibility that the retainer wires have become loose and not providing sufficient pressure over the teeth leading to relapse of the maligned teeth. I would therefore suggest you to consult your Orthodontist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and x-rays can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. You might need a fixed orthodontic treatment followed by repeated wearing of the retainers. The orthodontist might also advise you removable orthodontic appliances for re-achievement of alignment. You should also not delay the treatment or else there can be complete relapse of misalignment and then treatment can take a long time. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

After examination they formulated a treatment plan which includes -Scaling and polishing- Lower arch - Dental implants under local anesthesia, with or without adrenaline 1 is to 80000- Upper complete dentureThe following medication would be givenCap Phexin 250 mgTab EnzoflamWe have also provided them a brief medical history of my mother which includes her medical condition known as Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy, from what we understand from her symptoms for which is taking Tegretol, 200 to max 400 mg day. As per observation her seizure occurrence has been 2 seizures a day that occur every 15th or 16th day or at times an episode of seizure if highly stressed or unwell or traveling bound.We are satisfied with the treatment plan provided by this dental clinic. Now since she has this specific epilepsy condition that I mentioned above, we have been asked to get her family doctor or the doctor under whom she may be getting treatment for epilepsy to provide CONSENT letter about her general health so as to proceed with the dental treatment without any further complications.As such she does not have any specific doctor that has been treating for her for this condition and perhaps as suggested by some doctor in her late 20s she was recommended Dilantin, and then later on Mazetol and for last several years she is taking Tegretol which has pretty much kept her seizures in control. Although she has never been seizure free for a consistent period of time in spite of regular use of these medication, but to a large extent it is the only support system for her. I have read of anesthesia without adrenaline for epileptic patients and also that most epileptic patients can successfully get implants done.Could you please suggest what would be the correct course of action to be taken to avoid the least amount of risk or complication, before, during and after this treatment.
output: HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern for your mother if your mother is epileptic patient, and now she supposes to go for teeth extraction then no need to worry about this only matter is dentist should be informed for this and your mother would have taken a great care, hope this information helps you, take care and have a nice day.

input: I believe that my husband has been in contact with poison ivy. He had itching of the scrotum for a few days. Now his scrotum has enlarged to the size of a grapefruit. He says that they burn , feels hot and is excreting oil. It has now caused some sort of allergic reaction to the areas around his eyes. There is swelling around his eyes and cheeks. He is also getting a rash on his hip, legs and parts of his arms. I am giving him Benadryl , Motrin and over the counter creams for poison ivy. Nothing is helping. I am starting to get really worried because he doesn t want to go to the hospital. Could this cause more harm to him? Also is it contagius to me and my famille?

input: Hi, I ve been having pain in my right hand, all over. I don t know if it is something other than carpal tunnel, or the start of it. I don t have numbness though, but feel I should have it looked at somewhere. My index finger is so stiff in the morning that I can t even bend it! Yesterday, both hands were so inflamed that I had ice on it most of the day. At night I put on an arthritis cream, gloves, and loose hand braces. I usually take Tylenol for pain, but last night I took Ibuprofen (which usually makes me so groggy that I can t do anything else if I take it throughout the day). I don t know whether I would just need a cortisone shot (even though it usually takes two months to work), but what to do in the mean-time to get through work. I have pain throughout the whole hand, and it has even gone into my elbow. I have never done well with Prescription Medicines as they have given me stomach upset. Help! Thank you, Marge...Sorry I will not pay. Don t have the money, I work just a few hours a week. Thanks, but no thanks. I guess it s just inevitable that I need to seek help.

input: I had been taking 50 mgs of Zoloft and my doctor raised my dosage to 100 mgs, she did this to take me off xanax, which I had been on for 12-15 years, I was taking 2mg at bedtime to calm me down so I can sleep. I am now having tremors and involuntary muscle movements, always occuring through the night, and cant sleep now until the wee ours of the morning,

If sleep problem persists, the doctor can change this medication to a medication from the class of tetra cyclic antidepressants if your situation allows. I wish you a good health.

input: Hi, i had a tooth taken out about a month ago ,the cause started with receeding gums,which caused infection,and became to loose to save, i also have a recceding gum on a front tooth, i had never had problems with it before, but now my lower front gums are stinging,i brush mt teeth twice daily,and use a mouth wash 3 times a day,
output: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. The loose teeth, recession , inflammation all shows signs of chronic periodontitis. Using the mouth wash thrice will not help as it may cause over usage and in turn stain the teeth. I would advise you to visit a periodontist in your area and get your teeth cleaned professionally and then use the mouth wash for a few days. Use the proper technique of brushing. Use a desensitizing paste for a while. Once the teeth are cleaned and maintained well, the recession and mobility may reduce. If still persistent recession, the periodontist will plan the next treatment for recession. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

input: my son just fell off his new bed and hit the metal bar on the side causing an instant goose-egg below his eye on his upper cheek bone.  It is swollen and bruised, but my concern is that the lump is extremely movable and feels like a bag of gel.  What are your thoughts?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to hitting with a metal bar there has been soft tissue injury and due to injury there has been inflammation and swelling due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells at the injury site. There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. 

input: I have been sick for few months now. I had hives on my face first and then my lymph nodes got swollen and it hurted. I started having breathing problems and I still have breathing problems scince then. My tonsils are swollen too. I had periods 2 times in january of this year. And i have geogrophical tongue. its still there. I dont know what could it be? when I go to doctor they tell me its an allergy.
output: Hi! Geographical tongue is usually related to glossies, however, there are some instances that yeast overgrowth in the stomach can cause tonsils, pain in the submandibular lymph nodes/ pain and lymph adenopathy and later on will result to glossies. As we know that yeast can grow in an acidic environment and sugar-laden environment. However, there are several causes that the tongue may swell and that could be caused by allergens, nutritional deficiencies and/ or infections. If the swelling of your tongue/ glossies/ geographic tongue is caused by allergens then probably that is also the cause of your hives on the face. We need to treat the cause of your geographic tongue, if you think it is from yeast overgrowth in the stomach, then, a diet modification will do. Like avoiding acidic foods and beverages, avoiding cheese, nuts or those foods that is high in sugar and at the same time a probiotic Chat Doctor.  If you think it is caused by allergy then avoiding all the foods and allergens is the mainstay of prevention, and at the same time taking an antihistamine

input: I have a small (little larger then a pea) lump on the right side of my chin . i went to a dermatologist and he opened it expecting to find material inside. there was just blood . He injected it with cortizone and it didi get alittle smaller. 3 week later i went back and he injected it again. It has gotten even small but is still there. I go back in two weeks and if it is not significantly gone he wants to biopsy it. Does he think this is cancer?

Anyway as he has ordered biopsy you should go for it. Exact tissue diagnosis then can be easily made and treatment can be done. Cosult dermatologist.

input: Hi, I need help. Im having a lot of issued right now, I dont know whats going on. I have asthma, and I use my Advair inhaler everyday. But, a few nights ago I was perfectly fine one second, and then next second I couldnt breathe. I had to gasp for air, I thought I was having an anxiety attack, but nothing bad was happening; and thats never happened before. It lasted about five minutes, and then went away. But even now I have to take a lot more deeper breaths than usual. Also, earlier today I was using the bathroom, and sometimes when I get huge migraines, I feel like Im in a complete dimension. I had no headache when I went into the bathroom, I was completely fine, but as I was in use, for about five seconds I felt out of place. My whole body went cold, I was shaking, and my vision blurred and I saw two of everything. After about five seconds, I returned back to normal and nothing happened. Its really stressing me out, what is going on?
output: Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Since, how many days, you are taking AFFAIR inhaler as the ingredients are beta agonist+corticosteroids.  Now your main complaint is same breathlessness and cessation of breath. In my opinion consult a physician and get in complete examination of heart and blood for anemia and calcium (if corticosteroids uses for long time may cause calcium depletion and this causes such type of symptoms). Good luck.

input: Hi, I have middle back tenderness, and pain on gentle pressing of the spine specifically on one vertabrae. Also it feels that this vertabrae is very slightly enlarged, although not visibly. I am obviously concerned about this, but more so as lately my memory seems a bit impaired, and I am concerned it is related. What are the possibilities please?
output: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, you should know that the back pain and the tenderness while touching could be related to chronic degeneration of the spinal column. As the pain does not radiate and is localized only in the back and at one point, it seems to be just inflammation and not a herniated disc. Coming to this point, I would recommend a thoracolumbar column X-ray study and inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate, complete blood count). Regarding the memory problems they are not related to the back pain. Working too much or lack of a balanced diet could be the causes. I would recommend regulating your daily regimen (alternate work with relax pauses, try to have a good sleeping hygiene) and take a balanced diet (full of vitamins, proteins, lipids and carboy Chat Doctor.  Anxiety could also trigger all this situation. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes, 

input: I have a problem with what I think is maybe gastro.  However, I have had an abdominal ultrasound, HIDA scan, EGD/colonoscopy, and a CT of the abdomen that have shown nothing.  My PCP thinks that I possibly have IBS.  However, things seem to be normal in that area.  My problem is that I have a tenseness in the middle of my stomach just below the breastbone and belly button.  It does not hurt all the time but there is the tenseness. Sometimes it feels like something is sitting right under the breastbone.  When I touch/feel the area it is hard and if I press on it, sometimes it hurts just a little.  I dont know what else to try except MRI to try to figure out what this is, but I feel like it is something that is either being overlooked OR we have not gone in the right direction.
output: Hi. The probable diagnosis after reading your history and the findings is :small epigastric hernia, so easily overlooked. There is entrapment of the fat through small defects of line Alba (midline) whicChatDoctore and goes. Please check for this.

input: The joints in my hands started aching about two weeks ago. Both thumbs first and now both my hands. I d never had this issue before. I can t think of anything I ve changed as far as eating or physical. I go to my Dr. next week, but If I could ID what is happening, the pain would go away sooner.

input: I woke up early this morning with sharp chest pain ,it was so bad it hurt and I used inhaler to help. I also took a Motrin and layed back down. All day it s been a dull achy feeling in my chest . Also bloating in my abdomen and a little sore when I get up. I had my appendix out few weeks ago ,but this is different feeling ,I m also waiting to be seen for a positive rnp test ,I dint know if this pain has something to do with my mixed connective tissue disease.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your problem and situation. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), but better to rule out cardiac cause first for your symptoms. So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. It seems HERD more. Gaseous distension is also seen on HERD, and this is giving you bloating feeling of abdomen. GERD is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach, tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of dull aching, burning central chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Start proton pump inhibitor.4. Go for walk after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bed.

input: I received my MRI back and its states I have anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 without signifciant spinal canal stenois and moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing. Can you explain this? I thought neuroforaminal narrowing was considered stenosis. So do I have stenosis (narrowing) or not? Note the MRI also states I have spondylolysis grade 1.
output: Hello, Stenosis in your case refers to a narrowing of the spinal cord, it is a good thing that you don't have it. The term may be applied to neuroforamina, but narrowing is more appropriate. Listless refers to slipped vertebrae. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My Rhuematologist contacted me and told me that I had some protein in my urine. He would like me to take the test again in a couple of weeks. He said this can happen when a woman is on her cycle. I just didn t want to worry or stress over this unnecessarily. I should add all my other lab test were normal and if no concern. Is my Rhuematologist correct about menstration and protein in urine?

input: Hi I m from the uk but currently living in Spain me and my husband have been trying for our second child for a year following a miscarriage a Spanish gynaecologist has just given me utrogestan to take to improve my fertility . She told me to count 16 days from my first day of my last period then take it for 10 days to increase my chances of getting pregnant. My Spanish isn t great and English wasn t either just wanted to check this and it says can be taken by oral or vaginal which is best as I can t read the instructions there in Spanish thanks Michelle

input: I am having pain in right costo-phrenic angle since last 3 days. I had a small injury while playing cricket 3 days back. the pain is getting worse. i have had hot fomentation, local analgesics and anti-inflamatory drugs but no effect as if yet. please suggest me what could be the possibility and what can be done to relieve the pain. Thank you.
output: Thanks for asking a question. With right cost-phrenic injury there could be several other causes of your pain. Most common would be soft tissue injury to the muscles. Treatment would be similar to what you have already been trying. In addition to the muscle injury could be increasing muscle spasms which would gradually increase with time. Treatment again would be local heat or ice and muscle relaxants along with local massage therapy and physical therapy. Deeper injuries could be fractured lower rib or kidney contusion. Further testing would need to be done including x-rays urinalysis. I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor to do further testing and treatment

input: I had gall bladder removed two years ago and I continue to have pain on right side under rib Last night it hurt even to bend to pick up things. I m not sure if food isn t digesting properly causing inflammation? I took aleve and it helped a little. Worried

His doctor has diagnosed him with whiplash but took an xray that revealed no broken bones. However he called this morning and said that they found either a bone island or a shadow on his shoulder bone. We are medically minded people, but until today I d never heard of a bone island. He has ordered an mri to make sure if what it is. Of course I m worried and the internet has only made it worse. Any insight to this would be great.
output: Yeah, friend as a pedestrian I would suggest you to follow expert opinion given by orthopedic... If you have doubts visit other orthopedic with all previous reports...

input: I have had 2 episodes of pain developing pre-orgasm in my head (back of head at the base) and neck. It starts a couple of minutes pre-orgasm and peaks at orgasm. This starts as a dull ache and builds towards orgasm. I take 2 paracetamol and it settles within 15-30 minutes. It has happened on a couple of isolated occasions in the past. One of the recent 2 occasions was when masturbating so no great exertion was involved. My bloods indicate I am menopausal and I am only having periods about every 4 months currently. I am 53. I am on bisoprolol fro high blood pressure. I am also on Mirtazipine 45mg
output: Hi, Of course, pre-medicating with the same medicine that reliably works on pain 15 to 30 min after taking it is generally MORE effective than treating the pain after it has begun. I cannot say in your particular case and the pain follows a particular pattern which implies where the pain is from. Going from the neck to the back of the head is a very typical pattern for a nerve being pinched and/or a muscle spasm. Either of these can be treated with several NON-ADDICTING mild prescriptions. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: my sons age is 1year radiology report shows there is a difference in the size of the left kidney . the size of the left kidney is measured 7.7cms while the right one is 7.1cms. and the report shows duplex moiety of left kidney with renal pelvic prominence of lower moiety. what does it mean.
output: Good Day, and thank you for being with Chat Doctor !Your son has a congenital abnormality in his left kidney. It is called a duplicated collecting system meaning other than one tube Chat Doctor.  It will depend on if he has a complete duplication meaning he has two ureters(tube that connects the kidney to the urinary bladder) all the way from the kidney to the bladder or incomplete duplication where the two tubes will fuse somewhere in the middle and would have one insertion to the bladder. When we have a duplicated kidney we call the collecting system in the upper pole of the kidney upper moiety while the lower pole is the lower moiety. Prominence of the lower moiety means that it is more dilated than the upper pole. This means there might be some form of obstruction happening and should be investigated by CTS Can or MRI.  I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/

input: In 1985 I had a astrocytoma brain tumor which was removed. Following the crainiotomy I had 30 radiation treatments. About 10 years ago, I began having petit mal seizures, which my doctor said are caused by the scar tissue from my operation and radiation therapy . After trying every anti epileptic medication I am currently on Felbatol and Onfi. In October I experienced a different type of seizure becoming basically numb on 1 side of my body. I went to the hospital: One of the doctors said I may have had a stroke and another said I suffered from Todds paralysis . I went for an MRI and my friend who is a doctor said the results sounded like a stroke they saw a new white spot on my scan. My corrodoted arterty test came back ok and the EKG they did in the hospital was normal. I just went for both tests again.
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is good to note that you have no recurrence of astrocyte, after surgery and radiation therapy, nearly three decades after the initial diagnosis and treatment. Your current symptoms are due to a small stroke, as per the new MRI. Treatment is mainly with blood thinners such as aspirin.

output: Hi...please take him to his pediatrician immediately. If he is crying by just touching them it can be testicular torsion or epidymoorchitis. Both need immediate medical attention. I do not think a simple fungal infection or skin infection of the scrotum can cause this. The other possibility is that it could be cellulitis of the skin of the scrotum. Regards -

input: I was diagnosed with a giant cerebral aneurysm and I was wondering what hypotensive therapy entails and if it might be an option. I went to the hospital for a severe headache, and the subsequent CT scans, MRA s, and MRI s revealed the aneurysm. They performed an angiogram , and after the angiogram they informed me that the Aneurysm had thrombosed . I was released directly from the ICU the following day and for the last 3 weeks have experienced headaches and tiredness everyday. Thank you in advance for any help or advice.
output: Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor, You have mentioned that you have a cerebral aneurysm(Thrombosed). You must consult a Euro Surgeon to see if there is a surgical remedy to correct this for a long term solution. Thanks

input: i keep having tightening in  my upper chest bottom throat say , it also makes me cough to almost clear it it only last seconds , sitting down can bring it on or exercise but very rare , but mostly its tight clothing i also get a rattling feeling in my tummy when i breath deeply , this has happen all week about 20 times a day and even though this has happen for years its only been now and again ,  have been feeling really breathless , lately 33 year old female no med non smoker
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Chest tightness, cough, breathing difficulty etc. in young females (33 years) is mostly due to asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

I am noticing large white raw patches on the left side of my mouth, feels like its on the whole inside of my left cheek. Any ideas, how long it will take to get rid of or things I can do to get rid of this? Things to avoid eating! Thanks a lot
output: Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. The white patches could be due to many reasons like oral sub mucous fibrosis or leukoplakia.it is generally seen in habitual tobacco users and smokers. Please mention your habits if you have any?Also, please visit your dentist soon and get the tooth restored where there is cavity. Simultaneously get the current lesion examined.Meanwhile, use antiseptic mouth rinses. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.

input: i have 2 white spots in my mouth 1 is size of a small pin head(very small) other one is a thin small line at the bottom of my gum line.no pain.Im 48yrs old 5ft 3 and about 160lbs..Healthy except i get nigrines.I have been told by the dentist ive had gingivitis and i have receding gums..I deal with alot of stress daily
output: Hi I had gone through your problem. Already you had been told that you have gum problems i.e., gingivitis and receding gums. These problems will not cause white spots on the gums, which are painless. Second thing and important thing in your query is you deal with a lot of stress daily. Because of that stress some kind of white spots which are pain less, may form not only on the gums but also on the entire mucosa of the oral cavity. I strongly suspect that white spots may be because of that stress. Anyhow you kindly visit the dentist one more time. If those spots are same what I suspected, then the treatment is required apart from stress relieving methods. I think my answer would satisfy your query.

output: Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to arthritis. I suggest to use anti-inflammatory medications such as Naproxen to relieve the inflammation. I also suggest using cold compresses for local application. Furthermore, I recommend gentle stretching exercises. If the symptoms continue, you should see a rheumatologist. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hello, I have studied your case and I think that this can be an enlarged lymph node. It can be due to infection. I would also suggest you to show it to a breast expert, and he may advise you to get needle test or an ultrasound of the breast. It will give us final conclusion if you need any further treatment.  I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks

input: My 5 year old daughter has red blotchy irregular shaped and slightly raised rash concentrated in the folds of her body,even including her vaginal area and going far back between her buttocks.Her underarms are almost full of it.There are some spots on the rest of her.Its really scratchy.She has a bad cough accompanying it and sometimes watery eyes.I ve given her allergy medication.What could it be?

input: I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?
output: Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,

input: My husband is having pain in his testicles.  They are pulsating and he said he can actually see them moving.  He was diagnosed with an infection in his pelvis/groin two weeks ago and took a course of antibiotics.  Is this the same infection or is something more severe going on?
output: HIIT is not clear from your question about the infection he had. Had he recovered completely.? If he is feeling pulsations or a mass should consult a urologist and get it examined at the earliest to rule out infection again. Varicocele can be associated but will not cause pain in the majority of people. So a check-up is better. Hope my answer helps you. Regards

input: Is Eptoin safe to take even if u hav no history of epilepsy , as my husband had a seizure due to high viral fever, after wards all tests r ok i.e EEG , CT scan , he is normal back to work ,driving to office . But still prescribed Eptoin 100 mg - 2 tab in night/ 2 months as precautionary measure my question is is it safe to take it or will it make him dependant on these types of medications.
output: Hi, The medicine has been prescribed in order to prevent him from having another seizure. It would be best if the with Chat Doctor.  Though Option can cause side effects and problems, if he has tolerated it well for so long, the remaining course would hopefully be uneventful., There is no risk of dependence to Option.  Hope this helps

input: Had  a tibea plateau surgery about five years ago. A few days ago I got a severe pain at the middle of the shin that permeates down to the ankle making it hard to walk. It has been coming and going gor about a week now and the pain is so bad I cant sleep.
output: Hi, The pain can be due to infection, muscle weakness, or surgery gone wrong. You can take hot packs to soothe pain and don't force your body to bear weight on the limb as this will deteriorate the condition further It would be good if you consult an orthopedic for a thorough examination. For the time being you can take over the counter medicines like Ibuprofen. Hope this helps you. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Good Evening Dr,I have my sister who have done abortion last year as baby was sufferrring from "Spina Bifada" and doctor has insisted for abortion, she was in her 6th month of pregnancy. Now after a year my sister and broher in law are trying for baby but are hardly getting any success. So far we have approached 2 doctors who have recommended for folical treatment, they have already had there 5-6 trails on the same. Since there is no success both of them are getting depression since this treatment is more mechnical and has no result. Kindly suggest your advise Sir.Regards,sarika
output: Hi, Your sister and her husband should have proper counselling and guidance before trying to conceive again. Also, I presume the doctors have investigated for any tubal blocks and TORCH titles. Treatment for infertility is most often time and patience consuming. I suggest that they see an experienced infertility specialist to have further management. Unnecessary medication and investigation make the process complicated and unfruitful. Take care.

input: Hello Doctor I am 29 year old, going through the fertility treatment. All Hormone test, thyroid test, PCOS test, all seems to be normal. Semen analysis of my husband also shows all normal. Doctor prescribed me 100mg clomid from day 2 to 6 day. but the follicle size is not at all growing, till day 18. after 18th day the follicle size starts growing all of sudden 3-4 mm a day. And on day 21st follicle size became 24mm, My doctor then injected me with injection (I dont remember the name) , but that was for ovulation to occur then on 23rd day I ovulated(As per sonography reports, one follicle from my right ovary got ruptured). for continuous 3 days i had relation, but still I got my period on day 32 of my mensuration cycle. My doctor is now prescribing me to go for IUI. My concern are: 1. Why the follicle size is not growing when all my reports are normal? 2. why even after taking clomid the size follicle is not growing normally(1- 1.5mm a day) ? 3. Is my treatment is going on right direction? 4. Should I go for IUI? will it be helpful Please suggest Thanks
output: Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. Following is my reply:1) You might be having polycystic ovaries who generally ovulate late. This needs to be confirmed by scan from your doctor.2) Next time ask your doctor about using gonadotrophin injections which help in growing follicles.3) Your treatment seems to need upgrading. Please visit an infertility specialist.4) GUI has better success rate than trying naturally. Hence, you can consider it if there is difficulty to conceive naturally. I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any follow-up query you have.

input: Hi Dr. I realised that i have certain psychiatric problem in 2005 and started with Feliz S 10, Mirtaz 7.5 and Clonotril 0.5. Was asked to take for 2 years and I was fine after that. But the symptoms came back in a worse manner just 6 months later. Again, I was put on Nexito 10mg and clonotril 0.5. Later, the medicine was changed to Fludac 20mg and then to Nexito 10 mg back again from last 1 month. I feel better for some time during medication , but if medication is off, then i return to same panic, depressed and anxiety disorders. What could be a long term solution? I am 31 and married. Thanks for your answers!
output: Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor The medicines Felix S 10 or Escitalopram, mirtazapine 7.5 and control 0.5 are given in Depressive episode mixed with anxiety. You were given these medicines for about 2 years, so I assume that you had episode of depression. When symptoms reoccurred you were given Next or Escitalopram 10 and then fluoxetine 20. Both are of same group SSRI. Long term solution of your problem? Depression is an episodic illness, it tends to occur in intervals or in episodes. So if you responded to medicines and then relapse of disease occurred there is no surprise. You have to continue the medicines for long at least 2 years and also go for Cognitive Therapy for early response. Once you achieve pre morbid level then maintain the condition by Cognitive Therapy. Don't afraid of medicines as they are very safe Chat Doctor.  So visit a psychiatrist for opinion and continue medicines again. Thanks

input: I fainted on my front lawn, mostly I because I did not eat this morning and got dizzy and fell. I have also got fibromyalsia and have fallen before. Under Dr. s care.

My husband came from work to take care of my wounds like icing. My question is, since I can t stand up and it hurts a lot to touch, could I still have a sprain, even though no swelling or discolorization?

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Happy new year sirs. I have a problem with actute sneezeing. I have been suffering from this illment for almost 3 years. And eachtime i sneeze i see pint of blood when i spit. I hope you can have a solution to my problem.
output: Cellophane you for contacting Chat Doctor. Sneezing mostly occurs because of allergic response. As you have chronic allergy problem, so there must be some allergic element which triggers sneezing. If I were your treating doctor then I would have advised levocetirizine for it. Also, I would have suggested montelukast once daily for one month. Blood spit occurs because of severe sneezing response. It damages the mucosal lining which in return results in blood spitting. I would also suggest you to visit an allergist for detailed examination of what is the causative allergen, and then he will prescribe immunotherapy which will resolve it, hopefully. Thank You

input: I had elevated triglycerides at a recent doctor visit.  Doctor ordered an ultrasound and was told I had an inverted kidney during the test.  What does this mean and what might cause elevated triglycerides?54 - W male - 200lbs - diabetic - triple bypass surgery
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, i can understand your concern. An incidental finding of this malformation, is not of any worry. If the kidney is not atrophic(shrunken), it should be working well. If there are any other changes noted, you should've a CENT(contrast CT scan). Thatll show the function of the kidneys very clearly.You'll need to take statins for your high TGL.(triglycerides). If you've any doubts, you may send reports as a direct question, in my name.

input: Hello Sir, I am 28 years old married guy and below are the particulars of my sperm test report. Please have a look into this and interpret the results to me.. I am concerned whether I am sexually normal or do I need to consult a doctor for a baby. Volume: 0.5 ml Viscosity: Thin Reaction: Alkaline Sperm Count: 65 million/ml Active Motile: 60% Sluggish: 10% Non Motile: 30% Epithelial Cells: NIL Pus Cells: 2-3/HPF Erythrocytes: 0-1/HPF Morphology Normal: 80% Abnormal: 20% Others: NIL I am waiting for a quick reply. Thanks in advance for your support.
output: Your sperm count morphology motility in all in normal range except for volume ... A low volume (less than 1 ml) is an uncommon problem, and is often due to incomplete ejaculation (which is not rare because of the stress of producing a sample in the lab !) or spillage. Other than this a low volume might indicate an obstruction....

input: dear sir. my self mahesh i am 25y old male. i was suffer from vericocele since 7 year. i was done vericocele surgery before 4 year. but now i have slight pain on the scrotum, testis, & the surface of penis. also my penis size is 4 inch please tell me answer
output: Hi greetings. Usually varicocele will not cause pain in scrotum. Rarely long-standing can cause some pain which will disappear after lying down. So if you are having pain we should rule out some infection in epididymis and testis situated in scrotum. Coming to the size of the Penis it is very much normal and more than enough to satisfy a woman. So to confirm consult a urologist. Hope my answer helps you. Regards

output: Hi, SIR THANKS FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY !, A salute from civilian. Lets, start with understand what do we mean by "POLYNEUROPATHY", NERVES are like electric wire conducting the information from one point/ part to the brain and back, now nerve like electric wires have an insulation, but due to various reason the insulation layer gets withered and so the nerves will have issue concealing the information with the secure track (like short circuit as in case of electric circuit), and the information will be misrepresented as pain instead of mild touch or in matter of fact even heat can be represented by damage nerve to brain as PAIN. This is major issue in polyneuropathy, It's not yet possible to entirely replace the lost insulation of the nerve. Now cause for polyneuropathy are various as well as the treatment varies with different cause, Following are the causes and available treatment,1) Diabetic polyneuropathy - treat diabetes and keep sugar in control and give pain medication for symptoms of pain.2) Alcoholic polyneuropathy- Stop alcohol consumption, pain medication for pain if needed.3) Familial amyloid polyneuropathy - Tatamis (only approved by European Union not by FDA yet)4) polyneuropathies due vitamin deficiency - vitamin replacement. + pain medication for pain if needed5) Autoimmune polyneuropathies - Immunosuppression therapy, + pain medication for pain if needed. *********************************************************************************YES so the METHADONE AND OXYCODONE will help if taken correctly, and thanks for the COMMENT.

input: Hi, I m a 26 year old female, who has suffered with a number of health conditions in the past. Two years ago I had a large (20cm) benign schwannoma tumour removed surgically from a nerve behind my lung , and I also had blood clots across both lungs, which I was treated with warfarin for for 6 months. I have for the last 4 years been suffering from right lower sided abdominal pain , for which I still don t have a diagnosis. The pain varies from mild to occasionally very severe. My GP is of the belief I have endometriosis , but unfortunately I cannot have a laparoscopy as I am too overweight. I suffer from fatigue regularly, and regularly pick up chest infections and water infections. Just recently (one month ago) I had what my Doctor believed to be a kidney infection, and had a persistant high temperature on 3 different occasions. Following antibiotics and paracetamol it didn t bring down my temperature for 3 weeks. My GP now also considers that this wasn t a kidney infection, but I often have microscopic blood in my urine. The problem that I m having now is that my legs are aching horribly, and I have unexplained bruising on my arms and legs, as well as a chesty, wheezy cough. The pain in my legs is so bad that I cannot pull myself up off the bed/chair. I am suffering fatigue badly at the moment and I also have mild asthma which isn t helping the cough. My worry after having suffered from blood clots is that this may be a blood disorder. I also suffered from a nose bleed about 5 days ago, and it s very rare for me to have them, the last one must have been over 10 years ago. I do get a bit nervous when I am unwell, as when I was diagnosed with a tumour I spent about 4 weeks unable to breathe and with chest pain (and also had calf pain) which went unnoticed by doctors, who just thought it was a chest infection and gave me antibiotics. I m worried about something being missed again. Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

input: My son-in-law has terminal alveolar soft part sarcoma that he ha been battling for two years.......his doctor told him that there is no more treatment to treat him, as he is neutropenic. He advised him to make end of life plans to to what he wants to do,,,,see who he wants to see etc. Well, his WBC and platelets have come up this past week and he is in Florida. If there a reason WBC would increase suddenly if death is unavoidable?
output: Good morning. Your son-in-law is suffering from terminal illness, and he is neutropenia. The reason for sudden increase in his WBC counts can be the growth factors given to him by the doctor to increase his WBC counts to prevent the development of infections. Sometimes the lab report may be spurious that is another reason. But in any case no need to worry. Regards

This should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. Other possibility is adult ADD. In adult ADD poor focus, procrastination, indecisiveness etc. are seen commonly and this could lead to other symptoms which you've mentioned. So please visit a psychiatrist for evaluation and diagnosis. Thanks and Take care

input: I got my second ear lobe piercings done about 4 months ago. Its been taking a while for them to heal. Today I was changing and my ear got caught on my clothing and I pulled pretty hard. Now, its pussing clear liquid and is kind of throbbing and feels swollen and hot. Is it infected? I try to clean them regularly.
output: Hello, Infection of the ear-piercing can be due to wearing ear rings made of metals that are not inert in nature. Such metals decompose when exposed to air, water and can release decomposition products that can cause allergic reaction and infection. Some individuals with sensitive skin tend to get the reaction faster and can cause irritation, pain and fussing. So, first she should not wear earrings till the infection gets healed. Clean the ear-piercing site with Betadine solution and apply antiseptic ointment over it. Do cool compresses. Once it heals, she should wear earrings made of inert material like gold or plastic. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Beginning yesterday my tongue and throat/esophagus started feeling swollen. It has continued today. No breathing problems yet, but Im worried this is going to get worse while I sleep.  It feels like a lump in my lower throat. My tongue isnt super swollen but seems bigger that I notice it in my mouth, pressing against the front roof of my mouth. I also have been burping more than normal but do not have any burning sensation. Ive read several things but not sure what to make if it. I have a doctor appointment next week, but wondered if I need to see someone sooner. What are your thoughts
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor .com. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern about your tongue. As per your history, signs and symptoms it seems to me that you are suffering with allergic reaction to your tongue and throat, or it can even be the infection to the tongue too. You don't need to worry, in case there is any difficulties in breathing you need to visit the emergency room as soon as possible. Otherwise, there is no need, sometimes because of acid regurgitation there seems to be numbness in the tongue, and you feel it is swollen, but practically it is not like that. You can have pantoprazole in morning empty stomach once daily to reduce the burping and regulations. Also take antiallergic like. Levocitrizine to reduce any sort of allergy. If you feel any breathing difficulties please visit the emergency room. Hope my answer will help you and visit us back if you have any further questions. Regards Chat Doctor.

input: During intercourse I have had fluid in my lungs 3 times and today I quit before it got bad. I e-mailed my doctor but no answer yet. I don t have this problem anyother time. I found out it sounds like pumonary edema. I know it is to be checked and I have a stres test on Friday. Advice?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should avoid heavy exertion and take rest at home. Get done TMT (Trade Mill Test) first to rule out cardiac cause. There are many causes for fluid in lungs but when it is due to cardiac cause, we call it as pulmonary edema. So we need to rule out cardiac causes first. I advise you to get done 2D Echo also for evaluation of heart function. As decreased heart function lead to pulmonary edema.

input: Hi, I m expected to have my period in 2 days but I have been feeling some cramping pains like you would your period but it hasn t arrived yet...I don t usually get this pain without having a period a few hours later. I ve had this pain for 2 days now and it comes and goes, I also have some tiredness and heartburn . What should I do regarding these symptoms?
output: Dear Leana, abdominal cramps are, unfortunately, a usual symptom during and before the periods.  Cramps are caused by prostaglandins which cause uterus contraction. The contracting muscles help push the blood out through a girls' vagina during her period. So these contractions can be mild or very unpleasant and can vary from month to month. Also, other hormonal disbalances due to menstruation cause nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and abdominal swelling.  Girls who are younger when their periods start, who have longer periods or heavier blood flow and smoking are a risk factors for cramps. Heartburn can be related to this story, but also it can mean TAH you have some kind of gastric problems such as HERD, Ulcer/gastritis, so you should do gastrostomy to find the exactly what's going on. Use analgesics(nonsteroid) for pain relief because they decrease prostaglandin production in blood. To be sure that you're healthy do gynecology examination and pelvic ultrasound to check your uterus and ovaries and steroid hormone levels. Wish you good health, 

input: Hi, I am 18 years old, weighing 135-140lbs. I was born with a hole in my heart but it grew over before I was two. I have recently been to the hospital 3 times in the past two months for a reaccuring rash, medication for my ( what I think are impacted) wisdom teeth, and just today for a bladder infection. I have started drinking coffee for the first time around the start of may which is when I had medication for my teeth. I was wondering if it was the coffee or the medication, but Im having chest pains in the middle and left side of my chest. It feels like a fluttering then sharp shooting pain. If you can help it would be greatly appreciated.thanks Katie.
output: Dear Katie, Thanks for your query. If your hole was totally closed or not is an important consideration. Coffee intake can increase heart rate in susceptible individuals and may be responsible for certain causes of chest pain like HERD. It is best to avoid coffee till the issue is sorted out. Please take the help of your local cardiologist. SincerelySukhvinder

input: Hi. Iam 40 years old and attended the hospital for an ultrasound scan for a swelling under my right arm . The Radiographer told me to make an appointment to see my GP , to receive the results in ten days time. When I phoned the surgery , the receptionist said these things can take longer, and gave me 4 May to attend for the result. I am quite anxious, do these things usually take so long?

input: Dear Sir I,m problem with Premature Ejaculation within 5-10 Sec I finished my activities because I,m failed So whats I will do I have Diabetics & I will take metformin 850 two times a daily.So please tell to me whats kinds of Indian medicine I will take or whats treatment I already taken before therapy in before also.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. Most of the premature ejaculation problems are due to anxiety and apprehension, and they are purely psychological.

input: my son s circumcision was almost 2 weeks ago and the swelling continues until now. His Doctor was not around when we get back for check up so its another Doctor who attended to our problem. According to him, it s normal, we only have to use cold water for cleaning, apply cold compress .How long can we expect that the swelling be removed after applying above?
output: It will take 2-3 weeks for the complete healing. Another week or so and he will be fine. No need to panic if there is no oozing or bleeding from the wound.

input: Hi, I have stuffy nose and congestion from past many days now and it does not seem to be common cold/flu as I was suspecting it. It seems like alergy to me which is common in Bangalore during this time. Last year my doctor prescribed Tab Montek LC (1 at Bed time for 3 days) and Tab Montek 10mg (1 at bedtime for 7 days). Along with this she also recommended Capsule Mucolite SR (three times a day for 3 days). And after three days, she asked me to continue the Montek LC for another 5 days. Unfortunately she is out of town now. Can I take the same medicine and dosage?
output: Hi there!I agree with you over the fact that allergy is common to Bangalore, however all attacks of cold/flu cannot be attributed to allergy. Morever indiscriminate use of anti allergic is not advisable. What I have seen in general is intensive steam inhalation using capsules of Karol plus along with tab ivory will bring you good relief. To confirm an allergic etiology to your cold you should check your serum IG e levels. If elevated they need to be monitored and specific antigen needs to be isolated for long term precautions and benefits.I would also recommend you getting yourself evaluated for chronic sinusitis as this also contributes to chronic cough and cold in many cases. Chat Doctor. 

input: I was exposed to fumes from several theatrical lighting instruments in an enclosed space a few weeks ago. After trying inhalers and steroid treatment my lungs look clear. However, I still have issues with feeling faint when I am at all active, a metallic taste in my mouth, coughing up metallic tasting watery stuff, and shortness of breath that comes with the faintness. What could this be and what tests could be done to figure out what it is?
output: Hello, According to the history, you provide better to discuss with a toxicologist specialist for probably further follow up.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  

input: I have a cracked tooth, and yesterday, my dentist prescribed some vicodin. I have been taking 600 mb of Ibuprofen every 7 hours or so. Can I continue to take the Ibuprofen while taking the Vicodin? Also, if I don t take any Vicodin, how often can I take the Ibuprofen, and how many mg can I take each time?
output: You have to take either one of them they both are analgesics there is no use of taking two analgesics you can better take Vicodin and stop ibuprofen and also get your tooth checked properly and get an x-ray of the victim tooth if root of your tooth had not fractured than it can be saved by simply doing root canal treatment and giving you a ceramic crown which duplicates your teeth and maintain aesthetics.

Her liver sonograms looked ok but, her liver functions on her blood report are abnormal (besides her bile is in range). SHe had been vomiting and acid reflux frequently but, by reducing her medicine dosages have helped. I wanted to find out what is going on with her.
output: Hi, She has got metastatic breast cancer. Brain met scan be a cause of vomiting, Metastatic lesion in liver can be picked up by sonogram many a time, but there is a chance of missing it also. Anyway, there is treatment of metastatic breast cancer, at this condition, whole brain radiotherapy and hormonal therapy depending on receptor status can be beneficial, consult your oncologist.

input: my father is 80 yrs old and he is totally normal. Today we do some blood test of him like kidney profil,lever profile and other blood count, every results are normal but his ESR is 34 however as per normal value it shoule be max, 10, what is it meanig.Raj

input: I am having symptoms of a sore tongue and gums, like the skin in my mouth is tight.  It is a dull ache most severe on the sides of my tongue and lower parts of the inside of my gums.  My teeth are not sore and I really am healthy with no other symptoms.  It is painful to eat, hence the concern.  Anything you may be able to deduce from this?  Thanks for your help! Gabe
output: Hi. Thanks for the query. It looks like you have inflammation inside mouth. Due to inflammation you are experiencing pain and soreness. Inflammation and soreness can be due to numerous causes, but common ones are allergy to certain foods or chemicals, deficiency of or vitamin B 12 or both, burning the inside of mouth while eating something very hot or irritation with any chemical substances or mouthwash etc. Fungal infection can be another cause. So first consult an Oral Physician and get the cause ruled out. Treatment of the same will help in relieving the oral symptoms too. For now symptoms can be managed with gargling with numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine like Magic Mouthwash. Start taking vitamin B complex supplements daily. You can also do cool water rinses and suck ice as both of these can absorb heat and reduce inflammation. Avoid hot, acidic and spicy foods. Hope this helps. Regards.

input: Hi,<last week my 4yrs/Female kid was diagnosed with Jaundice, total bilirubin was 10.8 (8x + 2x), she has been talking medicine for 10 days now, a second blood report showed bilirubin total to be 32.x. Is it high? Is it serious? What count will be dangerous?  our pediatrician said today jandice is high, it will increase before coming down something like that. After a week of taking medicine, jaundice getting higher doesnt not make sense to me. How is it possible? Can please some give some advise? Thanks.
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to more complicated- High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. In children, common causes are Gilbert's disease or hepatitis viral. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting certain liver issues. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.

Vascular prominence centrally. Appearance suggest active atypical infection. May be complicated cardiac decompensation and early air space oedema.  She is a known hypertensive.

input: Hi! My 3 year old has had vomiting diarrhea for 5 days. Went to er on day 2 for dehydration. Today was the first day she ate and felt better. This evening we noticed swollen knees and hands and a rash on her elbows, knees, arm pits, hands. Benadryl has seemed to help. What could this be?
output: Hi...by what you say the same virus which has caused the diarrhea might have caused the swelling of joints and rash. It is common in viral illness. Another possibility is that it could be a reactive arthritis to the virus causing diarrhea. If the child is otherwise active, need not worry. Regards -

input: my 4 yr old has been complaining of stomach cramps and began running a fever she now is complaining of a sore throat and i noticed three red spots on her legs i am trying to figure out what is wrong with her as i took her to the er and they wernt sure what was wrong but said it could be possible she might be getting strep but said to give her advil for the fever and thats it.
output: Hi... by what you say I feel that your kid maybe having very early signs and symptoms of Enoch schooling purpura. This is a sort of systemic vasculitis which can cause red spots on the lower limbs along with tummy pain. If she is rolling over the bed in severe abdominal pain or red spots on her legs are increasingly palpable, then I suggest you get her back to the Emergency Room immediately. But skin conditions are usually diagnosed and treated at their best only after seeing them directly. So I suggest you upload an image on this website and then get back to us, so that we can guide you scientifically. Regards - 

input: I have a close friend in Germany, he just turned 60, and about 2 years ago he was diagnosed with some sort of blood disease, I cannot remember the name, but it is causing his white cells to increase and red cells to decrease so they are both falling outside the normal limits. They have told him to come in once a year and get checked. And it sounds like there is not really any good treatment available. I would like to know the name of this condition so I can research it, and also any info about prognosis . Thanks in advance, Diana O.

input: Yes, I was recently exposed for 7 hours to Professional Strength Goof Off (Xylene, Ethylbenzene, Butoxydiglycol, Acetone and Butane). I was diagnosed with Acute Chemical Bronchitis and treated with prednisone. Two weeks later had two pulmonary embolisms that I was hospitalized for 5 days. With no clinical reason for the PE s, could they be caused by the chemical or prednisone? I m a 64 year old male with pre-existing COPD. Thank you, Augie
output: I am suspecting that being a patient with COPD, your He would be in the higher side due to chronic hypoxia. That itself is a risk factor venous blood clotting. On top of that you must have been hypoxic due to the organic chemicals and the viscosity of your blood would have been increased both by the organic chemicals and the hypoxia and triggered off the pulmonary embolic.

input: My 9 year old son has had a reoccuring fever off and on every week and a half for the last month or so. The fever happens for a couple of days peaking around 105 along with headache and some stomach ache. He s fine in between these occurances. What could be causing this?
output: Hi, Having recurrent fever for long time requires some blood work to be carried out. Go for complete blood testing like TC, DC, platelet count, ESR, Report will give exact cause of having fever. After report your doctor will go for appropriate treatment. Give him light food. Ok and take care.

output: Big belly in skinny child occurs because of hypotonia of abdominal musclesExclude protein energy malnutrition In case of huge ascites, same condition occurs

input: I have sharp, pin pricking pain on my upper back. It stings and radiates pain around my shoulder blade (8/10 on the pain scale). There is no visable bite, marking, or redness on the skin. It is quite distressing, as it is a significant pain with no apparent source.
output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concernsWith such presentations in my clinic, I would firstly reassure my patient. Mostly this is Myositis or muscle spasm in the upper back muscles . I suggest also doing plain X-ray for cervical and thoracic vertebrae. I advise you to receive muscle relaxant and NSAID.

input: Have a 9 cm painful swollen bruise on the side of my left lower abdomen.Has fluid and a lump and is incredibly sore and all muscles around hurt and tummy is swollen tonight also. I noticed it yesterday afternoon starting to appear (it started as a hard lump sticking out, hardly any bruise) have not had a bash or fall. have been exercising a lot recently with weights and doing lots of sit ups. i am 34 years old. went to the doctor here in seychelles who gave me antibiotics? feel a bit worried.
output: Hi. You had a definite history of strenuous exercises like weight lifting and sit-ups. The strain on the muscle group must have caused a tear in the blood vessel to cause a collection of blood called hematoma. I would advise you to get a CT scan pertaining to this area to study and diagnose whether it is just a muscle tear of Hematoma formation. A large hematoma needs aspiration and tight bandage, full bed rest, review with ultrasonography for the progress. Antibiotic may not be necessary if the skin is intact. Anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxants work well. IT takes about 3 weeks of bed-rest.

input: I am 40 years lady. I had got high fever 1 1/2 months ago and had taken antibiotic course for 5 day. That time I got the urine tested. Pus Cells. 20-30/HPF,Epithelial Cells.4-8/HPF, Micro Organism - present. But there was no growth in CULTURE Report. Repeat test is done and presently it contains Pus Cells. 15-20/HPF,Epithelial Cells.2-4/HPF, Micro Organism - present Protein - Trace. Again CULTURE shows no growth. What is its implication? I am taking medicines for thyroid - 25 mg only. I am not experiencing any pain or burning senstation while passing urine at present or when I had got fever last time. I have the history of Urine Infection after birth of my child (caeserian) who is now aged 4 years . At that time also there was no pain or burning sensation but I had suffered from fever with bodyache.
output: Hii have gone through your question and I can understand your concern about fever ant UTI.as there is pus cell and bacteria present in urine it clears that you got a urinary track infection and your fever is also due to this. Before going to any conclusion I would like to ask you some question1) is there is weight loss in past few days?2) do you fell weakness?3) is there is any person in your surrounding who is suffering from tuberculosis.in almost all the cases of urinary track tuberculosis picture is almost same like yours. There is puss cell there is microorganism there is fever, but there is nothing in culture because tuberculosis bacteria need a special culture media for its growth, and it also takes more than usual time to growth.I will suggest you to go for a urine AFB test also request for culture for M.TB.also get an ultrasound done for your kidney hoping this information will help you and send the answer for my questions as soon as possible so that I can help regards Chat Doctor.

input: Using microgynon30, do I need to take the pill at the same or a regular time each day? I ve not taken the pills at a regular time each day (between 8am-2pm), and pretty sure a few times I forget a day and take it the next morning (and that day s in the evening or not at all). I m on microgynon30. Should the pill still cover me as contraception if I m taking it, almost haphazardly, like this?

input: I am inquiring about the concern of a dear friend who has been mostly confined to her bed for the past 6 weeks due to the following symptoms: extreme weakness, dizziness, hands shaking, aching all over, headache, limited intake of food, became dehydrated and had to go to the hospital for iv fluids.  Shes had a cat scan and blood work which did not show anything, and the doctor shes seen in Scottsdale, AZ does not know whats wrong.  Early in Sept. she had Shingles which affected her back, arms, neck and torso.  Do you think she should be examined by a neurologist.  She also has had Fibromyalgia for years.
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I appreciate your concern for your friend. Yes, it would be very useful for her to be examined by a neurologist. Her present symptoms may or may not be related to the past episode of shingles. After examination, she may require MRI of brain and spine, and blood work such as thyroid profile, serum vitamin B12 level, etc. to identify the cause. I hope my answer helps.

output: Hi, Ideally, BP should 130/80 mm Hg. A high surge of systolic BP can cause dizziness.

input: I had a vasectomy 14 days ago. It was a no scalpel coterized open ended type of vasectomy. My testicles are still pretty tender and I must be careful not to bump them with my hand or something as this causes pain. When I am resting, I don t feel any pain. Is this normal after 14 days? Is so, how much longer till this issue goes away? Also, when my ball-sac hangs loose, it looks a bit deflated since having the procedure. Is this normal?
output: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Pain after vasectomy for such a long period is abnormal. NSV or non scalpel vasectomy will never cause loose or deflated testicles. So pain may be because of the infection or some other thing.

input: I ve been experiencing a substantially increaed frequency of painful muscle cramps in various parts of my body (i.e., almost daily) since I began R-Chop chemoterapy for Stage 2 Lymphoma last September. Consequently, on the sixth and last treatment I had six days ago, the Oncologist in charge left out the component of R-Chop called Vincristine . She did this because she thought it was the only component of R-Chop that could possibly cause muscle cramps and, at the same time, was the least important doe chemotherapy . Since then, I haven t experienced a single muscle cramp. Do you think this provide(s strong evidence that Vincristine was the cause of my muscle cramps? Is there proof that Vicristine does, in fact, cause muscle cramps?
output: Hi, Christine is causative agent for neuropathy any way symptoms may sometime not very clear to any particular Chat Doctor.  R-CHOP regime is used in CD 20+ NHL. Rituximab has maximum efficacy with doxorubicin. Please consult your oncologist.

If any one of these is positive, then we are justified in giving an antibiotic. Regards - 

input: About 3 months ago I had sharp pains in my right thumb off & on for about 2 days & then it went away. Now for about the last 6 wks I ve been having a lot of stiffness in top joint with pain especialy when I wake after doing a lot of gripping or lifting the day before. It s like a catch in that joint that s very painfull especially the first several times I try to bend it. I work with my hands so this is very troubling .Any ideas? Thank You.
output: Hi, Thanks for your query. Although it isn't possible to diagnose your condition without an examination and a few tests, your history is suggestive of arthritis of thumb joint. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedic for detailed examination. You may get the X-ray/MRI, some blood tests and joint fluid analysis under his/her guidance to reach the accurate diagnosis. Use heat and cold to manage pain. Both heat and cold can relieve pain in your joint. Heat also relieves stiffness and cold can relieve muscle spasms. Apply over-the-counter pain creams. Creams and gels available at the Chat Doctor. Take diet rich in calcium, vitamin d3 and minerals. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Start proton pump inhibitors. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.  Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Hello, I ve dislocated my shoulder exactly 13 months ago.I had to carry my hand for around 1 month in a white thing so it can repair. After that I was careful and for 6 months I ve done no sports only the exercises my physiotherapist gave. But still after 13 months when I do some exercise like for example some tennis I feel my muscles kind of burning and weird. I am afraid tht they are not healed well and that I must stop tennis or other sports. Maybe it s fear that blocks my muscles but not so sure. I would like to know what to do, does it need a surgury so I can be able to play tennis without these problems bothering me?

input: I had proton radiation therapy about 2 years ago and my psa has been dropping to.09. I now am experiencing blood in my urine and the passing of tissue. I had a test with a scope and my urologist noticed some inflamation or something on my bladder and I am scheduled for a biolpsy tomorrow. i understand that it may be inflamation or bladder cancer. Is this typical after radiation? What is the cure if it is scarring and what is the cure rate if it is cancer.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Scarring is more common after radiation than cancer. So for your symptoms, possibility of bladder scarring is more than bladder cancer. But biopsy is must differentiate between these two. So get done biopsy for the diagnosis. If it is scarring then treatment is available and your problem can be solved. But if it turned out to be malignant then you need to get done staging of the cancer. Future treatment will be decided on staging of the tumor only. Early stages of bladder cancer is having good prognosis with life expectancy of 6-7 years. End stage bladder cancer is having life expectancy of less than 2 years. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

I have had x-rays, bone scan and an MRI, the bone scan showed that there is an increased uptake in the l5 vertabrea on the left side and scoliosis in the right side of the l5. According to the pain specialist that I have been to see, I have a mild case of arthritis probably due to a slight fracture from when I fell that was not picked up on the original x-ray. I have been taking percoset since feb, and my doctor is now telling me that I am too dependent on the percoset and that I am too depressed and has prescribed me m-eslon 15mg morphine sulfate. My problem is that I am not depressed, just in pain everyday and I wanted to know if my doctor is providing me with the right medications because a lot of people have told me that the morphine pills are much stronger and more addictive than the percoset. Is this right?

output: Welcome to Chat Doctor, after a head injury treatment will start from first maintaining his airway, breathing and circulation.  The headache after injury is due to the increase in CSF pressure, so the next step will focus on maintaining the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. So we use mannitol, and hypertonic saline is used. These reduce the CSF pressure.  While doing these things your father might have been investigated with ct brain which will tell you whether he has intracranial hemorrhages.  In your follow-up please tell us and upload his ct results which will be of more use in treatment plan.

ECG2. 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms. If both are negative then get done 1. Chest x ray2. PUT (pulmonary function test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection and PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. So consult cardiologist and pulmonologist and first diagnose yourself, then start appropriate treatment.

input: i have been having chest pains for the past 2 months now and im only 17. i have been to the doctors 6 times. the first couple of times they said it was muscle pain but the tablets never worked. next time i went back he said it was deffenatly not my heart and that made me less worried because ive had panic attacks over this. i went again because i was scared and to calm me down he gave me an ecg test and it came back fine. they now think its due to worrying to much but i cant help but think different. it is not a bad pain, it is usually on the left side of my breat near my arm. sometimes on the right but hardly ever and sometimes theres a slight tingle in the middle of my chest. also i have little tingles in my hand and fingers and shooting pains. the pains everywhere mostly feel like shooting pains. please help me, im very scared.
output: Hi, This is Chat Doctor. Pain in chest due to heart disease is very rare at your age. Chest pain due to heart disease is non localized, squeezing type & increase on exertion. Still you need to do a 2D Echo for cardiac evaluation. Chest pain at your age can be simple muscle pain or Costco

output: Dear patient What surgery was done, and spinal fixation was done or not? Were your symptoms improved after surgery or there was no improvement?  If your mothers symptoms remained same after surgery with no improvement it suggests surgery was not done properly. If symptoms improved after surgery for few years and now there is recurrence it can be 1. Disc prolapse at adjacent level 2.  Spinal instability.  This needs to be investigated with MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine to confirm diagnosis. You need to consult expert spine surgeon with report.  All the best.

input: small lumps have been suddenly forming on one leg, on the shin and near the ankle. no sign of varicose veins... there is a burning sensation, I suspect nerves. I m a klutz, and have too many injuries to remember. last was a badly sprained ankle that didn t mend well
output: Hi, Dear thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual clinic. I studied your query in full details updated from you. I understood your health concerns. Based on your query data, In my opinion, Dear You seem to suffer from Varsity of the Short Saphenous Vein with multiple bumpy swellings on shin/ankle on one leg. Burning pain sensation is due to rural neuropathy due to pressure from engorged Varicose Lumps and stretch of the surrounding soft tissue. Multiple injuries could only expedite the basic defect of Varicose Veins in your case, but should not be directly correlated to cause the burning swellings on shin and near ankles. So your suspicion is wrong and could be confirmed by second opinion to evaluate your case clinically. Color Doppler study would confirm this. For this treatment GP and Surgeon and Vascular Surgeon team would be needed to treat your case. Hope this reply would help you to evaluate your case and treat it with your doctors in time to come. Hope this would resolve your query and worry and Anxiety accompanied by it. Welcome for any further query in this regard to ME. I would love to help you out.Awaiting any further query. Wish you fast recovery from this intriguing health problem. Have a Good Day. Chat Doctor. N.M.S. Genl-CVTS -Senior Surgical Consultant

input: A friend has been diagnosed with throat cancer, an small tumor has been removed...I don t know the area of the larynx involved. My question is: would it be normal not to follow up with chemo or radiation? Also, his hands have been red, swollen and the nails have been looking like a fungal infection... could this be a side effect of the cancer and indicating it is still there?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Treatment of any cancer depend on its staging. And for staging we need to know exact size of the lesion, lymph nodes involved or not and Metastases to distal organs present or not. So in your friends' case we need to get done CT neck and PET scan to know the exacts tagging. And usually chemotherapy and radiotherapy is needed to prevent local recurrence and distal metastases.  So better to consult oncologist and start treatment.

input: I used the shower head to shoot water up into my vigina kinda like doushing. And I swear to god I felt ALOT of air go up at one point and now I have a weird feeling/ pressure all around my belly button area. Is it possible by doing this I caused a air embolism and if so what should I do!?
output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. There is a possibility that the feeling might be due to some kind of inflammation/infection in the pelvic organs which could have been started by the act of yours. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine and microscopic urine test followed by a culture sensitivity of the urine if need be and treat the same accordingly. Before jumping onto any other investigation, I would go for a general physical examination of yours with special attention to your lower abdomen, a gynecological check-up if thought necessary, and an ultrasound of abdomen at the end. Till then, I would advise you to go for an anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: i just got over an upper respiratory infection.  When I was done my antibiotics and was feeling fairly good I went out to do a couple of errands.  I was ver tird that evening.  I woke up during the night and took my temperature.  It was slightly under 95 degrees.  I took it a few minutes later and it was a little over 95 degrees F.  It seems it goes down when I am in bed and then goes up during the day to normal.  When it goes down sometimes I get dizzy.  I called doctors ofc and spoke to the physician asst and she wasnt concerned about the low temp.  She thought the dizziness could be vertigo.  I am worried and I dont want to bother them over the weekend.  What are your thoughts on this.  I read that if an individual has hypothermia and their temp goes below 95 degrees the organs can shut down.  Would this be true for what I am experiencing?
output: Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, such low temperature is nothing to worry because without the obvious clinical sign this could be functional, at the most this could be due to low water intake and take care for this, hope this information helps, have a nice day.

He found nothing to be wrong.  This continued and we went to see a lung specialist who did a CT scan. Found nothing to be wrong. At the same time my husband started to lose some of his taste.

We did see an ENT who found nothing wrong.  We went to an endocrinologist and eventually a parathyroid was removed.  Prior to that he was so fatigued he could hardly get into bed. After the surgery he wasnt as fatigued but still he not getting better.  Since August he has lost around 35 lbs. We went to a neurologist who took extensive tests including an MRI. He saw some evidence of Myasthenia Gravis. When he gave him Mestonon, my husband was going to the bathroom alot and had a crampy stomach. He did not feel better and the medication was stopped.

input: Hi, I was holding the lease on a big dog and he pulled me into a wooden fence and it caused me to have this heaviness and very bad aching in both my legs. I tried Gabapentin for a couple of years and it bloated me. I have nothing for them now. Can you help me? Carolyn Baylies Thankyou for reading this Doctor

It's important to know if you also have numbness and any altered sensation in the legs and feet.

If Gabapentin is not helping you please stop and take short courses of a celecoxib with muscle relaxant combination. Therapy in a heated pool will be good for you. Good luck and hope you get better soon

input: we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really dont want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .  Concerned about side effects of med.... maybe things will subside when reflux clears up?  Thanks so much for any help you can provide!!!   Heartfelt thanks!!
output: With such presentations in my clinic, I would prescribe Comparison 1 tablet 3 times after 15 min before meals. It is gold standard for acid reflux. Kindly follow Partners diet 1, don't give him ice or other tea, it will increase acidity, avoid chocolate and cheese, it can cause migraine also. Begin to take flax seeds(boil 1 tbs in 2 glasses of water, take 1/2 glass before meal twice a day). Give him yogurts, probiotics(Similar), it will decrease nausea and increase appetite. For headache migraines you can use 1 tablet of Diclofenac and 1 tablet of Risperidone.  Hope this helps

input: I am having unusual side effects to a new med. sore muscles and joints, tender and sore fingertips. a feeling of needles in knee joints and shoulders. I ve been advised that these symptoms don t relate to med. side effects. what else cause this unwell feelings?
output: Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As mentioned, medicines do not give a side effect of soreness or joint pains, medicines give symptoms like - nausea, skin rashes, constipation, etc. Now, coming to your musculoskeletal problems, you have tender and sore fingertips, feeling of needles in knee and shoulder, you need a thorough musculoskeletal assessment.These reactions could be due to some other factors like soft tissue pathology or a nerve pathology, which post assessment can be understood better. Also, performing regular exercises will help to improve the metabolism and immune system. Once, the root cause of the problem is identified the proper measures of treatment planning will be taken.

input: I am very light headed and dizzy, specially when I read , I am on Crestor and wonder if this med. can cause this. I had a spell one night of a severe headache and very dizzy, they took a MRI and I have a Schwannoma , very small and non cancerous close to my ear, nothing wrong with my ears just deaf more on the side where the Schwannoma in on . I have no ringing in the ears, and when I turn around in bed no dizziness just when I read it stays with me for about 40 minutes. So looking for a cure. Now I had cataract they were removed 3 years ago, now my eye docter says I have a dirty lense, so waiting for a Eye Surgeon, could this be theGen problem??? Please give your option, just now just writing to you I am very lightheaded and dizzy. Thanks for your opinion , this is really bothering me.
output: I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. Regarding Creator I would say no, that Chat Doctor. As for the Schwann, while it is a benign tumor, if big enough it can cause dizziness, it seems to have affected your hearing, so I would not exclude a contribution of it to your condition. However since it is a small one doesn't explain all your symptoms. Coming to the eye issue, given the fact that the symptoms surface when you read it could well be the cause. It can cause headache and dizziness due to the strain on the eyes and the muscle tension it leads to. So it must be consulted with the eye surgeon. I hope to have been of help.

input: For about a week or I cant open my mouth very wide without it hurting. Troublesome to eat. Simuntaneously, when I open my mouth,about half an inch or so in front of my ear, it bulges out, like bone or something. This doesnt occur in my right jaw. Im 68.
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... As her your complaint it seems that you have a DISLOCATED JAW JOINT [TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISLOCATION] leading to painful movement and bulging of the articulating portion of mandibular bone in front of the ear, and it can occur due to trauma, opening the mouth too wide for multiple reasons. You should consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and get an ORTHOPANTOMOGRAM [OPG] done so that the exact status of the jaw joint can be evaluated and treatment can be planned. You can be referred to an ORAL SURGEON who can manually re-locate your jaw into the anatomical position but in case if it is not successful you may need a surgery for re-locating your jaw.

input: i HAVE UGLY BLACK LEGS & ARMS. hOW DO i LIGHTEN UP? i AM FAIR SKINNED OTHERWISE
output: Hello! My dear, whatever may happen never refer to yourself as ugly. Beauty is a perception... and It's not always external.... ! Dark color of your arms and legs could be due to harmful effects of Sun. First and foremost always apply sunscreen. The right method of application is that apply liberally, 10 - 15 min before stepping out into the sun and re apply after 2-3 hours. A broad spectrum sunscreen such as Uncross aqua gel will be good and non-sticky for a tropical climate. For lightening, you can try creams such as Bolivia but considering it is a large body part it is usually not continent to apply creams. You can opt for Chemical peels such as Glycol or TCA peels, for which your cosmetologist can guide you. At home, you can try a mix of gram flour(began) with milk, apply like a paste keep for 5 min and wash it off, you can do this 2-3 times a week and follow it with a moisturizing lotion. Let me know the progress. Take Care Best Chat Doctor. 

input: I went to my doctor several weeks ago for severe knee pain...back of the knee. He gave me some obscure diagnosis without even looking at my knee, just moved it around. It s not any better and now I have ankle swelling on the same leg. The ankle doesn t hurt, but I m concerned.
output: Dear User, What is your age? How did the pain start? Did you get injured? What was the diagnosis given? Ankle swelling with knee pain is usually after trauma if any. Otherwise, ankle swelling may have some other separate cause. Which medicines were advised to you?

input: Numbness in left foot with tingling. The other day my left leg gave out on me after I had been standing still for a few minutes. I do have back problems, ie. spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, compressed lumbar vertebra, etc. Worried about the leg giving out and when I tried to walk afterwards, walked like I was shambling...or not really feeling the ground.
output: Hi there, Tingling, numbness and the feeling of leg giving away is an indicator of sensorimotor neuropathy which can occur due to a nerve root compression. You need to get an MRI of the spine done to rule out the same. Thank you.

input: My husband has 3 dark purple veins on his scrotem and what appears to be a spot by one of them. They have been there quite a while and sometimes are uncomfortable but not painful. The spot is on the left side and gets caught in his underwear and can occasionally feel achey. Should we be worried.
output: HelloThanks for query. Based on your statement I would say that your husband has three prominent superficial veins on scrotal sac, These are dilated, prominent superficial veins over scrotal skin and nothing to be worried about it . He should use soft inner wares or soft pads over scrotal sac before putting on inner wares. These are harmless and there is nothing to be worried about it. Chat Doctor.

input: My 2 1/2 year old fell yesterday and hit her head on concert. There was an instant bump popped up on her head. She acted completely normal after a few minutes. She went to sleep about 2 hours later me and my husband woke her up two times throughout the night. But today she is napping more and has diarrhea is this normal or what should I do?
output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Although the diarrhea is not related to the head injury, napping more in a child of this age is difficult to judge or rule out to be due to the injury. If I were your doctor, I would have advised you to keep a close watch on her level of consciousness to see if she is responding normally to your routine talks with her, and if she is moving her limbs normally, and has not got any vomiting. The bump on her head is due to collection of blood by the injury, and will subside gradually. In case of any change in the level of consciousness of hers to your commands, and any increase in the bump on the head, I would advise you to take her to the ER room of the nearest hospital, where they would examine her closely and if considered necessary might go for some investigations like a CT scan to rule out any concealed head injury. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: My doctor gave me AcipHex for reflux. After about 4 days of taking it, my b/p has gotten down at times to 85/57. I know it s down because I start to feel cold, then check my b/p and confirm it s low. I bordered on high before. I m pretty sure I am having gall bladder problems due to the pain in my side, and it is better since I ve cut fat almost completely out of my diet. Is my gall bladder causing the low b/p, or the AcipHex?
output: Cipher (omeprazole) may cause hypotension. But it's usually associated with hypersensitivity reactions that includes symptoms like facial puffiness, difficulty in breathing and others. If these symptoms are absent, then It's highly unlikely that omeprazole could be causing hypotension. And regarding the gall bladder, not much information is mentioned so that we can comment on it. I would recommend a consultation with your gastroenterologist for that. Hope the above information helps. Thanks.

input: 36 year old male. Hours after ejaculation I have brown particles in my urine. I have seen a urologist and had a CT scan and an x-ray and they found nothing, went back for a cystoctomy to scope the inside of my bladder and found nothing unusual. I did find out after the x-ray and CT scan that I only have one kidney; I never knew that. I have no abdominal or back pain, nor do I have pain during urination, I only know that something came out when I look into the toilet. I called my urologist after this happened again, I acquired a sample to bring in, they told me its probably a blood clot and not to worry about it and not to bring in the sample. I also have a hydrocele/vericocele on my right spermatic chord.
output: HelloThanks for query. Based on your statement that you have posted the brown particle that you have passed in urine hours after ejaculating is likely to be a blood clot mixed with urine which gets turned up into brown color. In the majority of cases this blood clots originates from a small superficial surface of prostate and gets sealed off itself immediately that causes a tiny blood clot to appear either in semen or urine passes after ejaculation. Since this is single episode and all the tests like C. T scan, X-ray and Cystoscopy did not reveal any pathological lesion you should not worry about it. If you have pain or discomfort due to Varicocele that you have on Rt side use scrotal support. This will prevent sagging of testicles and give relief from pain or discomfort. Chat Doctor.

input: Hello, my name is Nikhil Malhotra and i am 23 yrs old as of now. My height is 5.9 . Little concerned about whether it would be possible to increase my height by 2 - 3 inches using any of the natural means or any of the ayurved or homeopatChatDoctoredicines. Ans, if possible, would these be medicines having any side effects at present or in the future..??
output: Dear NikhilAfter gaining the age of 18 years the growing points in bones fuse to get converted into bones, thereby stopping the process of growth. So in your case it may not be feasible to add height with medicines. Yes with a lot of exercise you may feel marginal increase, even this has remote possibility. I believe 5-9 is a good height.

input: I want to share with you about the problem of my sister. She is 30, Neuro Patent. couple of years, she had a minor worm in her mind. take regulary Valprin Chromo 500 mg two times, Phenobarbitone 90 mg at night. She is almost ok. but the problem is she dont listen of family members. awake the whole night, sleeps at day 8 - 4 pm. Negative things about some family members, always keeps doubts, etc. Watch TV alot. Behaves Lazy. Where should i take consultation by Psychologist or Psychiatrist.  Kindly reply,Aditya BhargavaMb. 0000
output: Hi, From the information you have provided, your sister was found to have a parasitic infection in her brain for which she was put on sodium valproate 1gm and phenobarbital 90 mg. She maintained well till recently, and there has been a change in her behavior and her sleep pattern apart from having doubts regarding her family. Any sudden change in behavior, sleep pattern, symptoms of auspiciousness or changes in personal care etc. may be signs of a mental illness, and she may need medications for the current symptoms and hence it would be good to take her to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and treatment. Hope this helps, Chat Doctor. 

input: I got diagnoised with a UTI two weeks ago.. I have had a sore back for over a year and I think I have had a UTI all this time.. I am on Cipro 500mg.. I just ran out and they ordered more.. I have pain going into both of my legs and ouch moving pains on both sides of my back?? When should I go to ER? What are warning signs and what could be causing all this...
output: Dear patient Back pain with UTI may be due to pelvic inflammatory disease which is inflammation of pelvic organs. But since u out have pain going into both legs' possibility of disc prolapse or canal stenosis is more likely and seems a different condition from UTI.  Are there any difficulties in walking or tingling and numbness in both the legs? If yes then it also points towards canal stenosis.  You need to be investigated with MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine as it gives detail information of discs, nerves and even bone. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it done. Visit spine surgeon with report.  Meanwhile, start tab diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside combination twice a day for pain relief plus tab vita B12 plus pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime for 10 days.  Also get examined and search for the cause of recurrent UTI.

input: While on a dialisys treatment I started to cramp in my toes and asked that the removal of fluid be stopped. After about 20 min. my calf muscle cramped up so quick and hard, I felt a sharp pop severe pain. I could not walk very far. Did I rupture or tear the upper part of the muscle.?
output: Hi, Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition where the muscles in your leg suddenly become tight and painful. It usually occurs in the calf muscles and in most cases there is no obvious cause of it If it happens sporadically then there is no need for any treatment or tests. But if this is common and affect your daily routine then some measures should be taken. In some cases, there may be predisposing conditions such can be seen in pregnancy, after exercise and certain types of medication, such as statins or in liver disease. The best way to manage this is to stretch your muscles regularly. In some cases, magnesium or calcium supplements may help Have enough fluids and avoid long sitting, regulate body mass. In cases of progression or if there is no improvement, you need to see doctor, to rule out some naturopathies or vascular disorders which are much less common but should be considered if there is no improvement on these measures that I have mentioned. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: 1. symptoms now: shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, reduced ability to do anything, bluish color to palms, veins more prominent throughout body, chest pressure, chest pain (pinching feeling) on right side, headaches, numbness of hands, feeling cold.DOCTORS DID A CHEST X-TRAY AND ECG ON MONDAY. SAID EVERYTHING LOOKS NORMAL. THEYRE TRYING TO PASS IT OFF AS STRESS OR ANXIETY/PANIC ATTACK... I THINK THERES ANOTHER REASON(S). 2. 1 yr ago to now: itchy reddish rash that comes and goes many times during the day or sometimes once a day. appears as a cluster of bumps, scratches or wales. lasts for a few minutes at a time. happens whenever I lean against any hard surface, or if pressure is applied to the skin (bracelets, watches, testing pressure etc.)3. electric shock in spine.THANK YOU!!!
output: The first problem sounds like a congestive cardiac failure. Now where the EKG is normal, the possibility is that the echocardiography may show some changes. So I will suggest an echocardiography.2. Pressure sores and redness are common, one need not worry too much about it. However, if you can upload an image of the lesion, we can help you better by looking at the lesion3. Spine pain and trauma may often cause similar symptoms. I will suggest the test of MRI of the affected part of the spine. Let us know the reports, so we can help you further Best of luck Chat Doctor.

Is it a blood vessel problem? My age is 58 years, non smoker, only social drinker. height about 5ft 10 inches.
output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some skin adnexal tumor or tumor arising from nose like potato tumor.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: I just got my tooth extracted 3 days ago. I am taking painkillers and antibiotics for it. But after a day I experienced diarrhea . I have observed that there is some weird liquid coming out from the portion where my teeth is extracted. Please help me Doc. I want to know what is the problem with me and what I will do to e well. Here is my email: YYYY@YYYY Thanks
output: Hi there, Most likely you could be having antibiotic associated diarrhea. Antibiotics sometimes mess with the normal good bacteria that exists in our intestines and cause diarrhea. You could take VINYL (lactic acid bacillus), one capsule 2 times a day. This might help bring down the diarrhea. Preferably take the medications after food unless your doctor has specified that it has to be taken before food. The liquid discharge should come down in another 2-3 days, once the course of antibiotics gets over. In case it is persisting after 3 days, please visit your dentist. Rely Chat Doctor. 

input: Hello, Thank you for taking the time to answer my question if possible. My name is Jordan I am a 22 yr, old female. I have always had abdominal problems my whole life and 8/24/2011 I was told I had pancreatitis in an emergency room, I have ruled out basically everything that causes pancreatitis. My lipase isnt always high when it is bad. I have a terrible family history from multiple forms of cancer to gallbladder and kidney stones to heart problems. My life has gone down hill dramatically the past year. I cant do anything anymore, I have zero energy, just the wieght of holding my body up is unbearable. I constantly cant eat or sleep becuase im either to nausious or in to much pain. BUT recently this past week i have only slept for probaly 10 hours within the past 7 days and eaten almost nothing, My pain is so severe and sharp that I cant walk and it will stop me right in my tracks where ever I am. My pain is constant but gets worse everyday, Over these past 7 days I have noticed the pain in my back has gotten so severe that just laying on my body is literally impossible and I noticed my back was really sore to the touch and I looked at it in the mirror and noticed it was a small bruise starting and it was very itchy. Since then the bruise has gotten worse and the itching has become worse. I have constant chest pain as well so this makes my breathing even more labored and painfull. I am just getting very scared becuase this is happening so fast. At this moment right now I cant even walk at all, moving anything in my torso is the worst pain I have ever felt, I have learned to deal with horrible pain on a daily basis but this is new and to much, I know my body and I know something very bad is happening. Please i will answer any questions and any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated, Thank you for reading this. Have a good night. -Jordan (female/22)
output: Hi Jordan. Thanks for talking to me via ChatDoctorPancreatitis is a serious condition, and you should not take it lightly. You really need to be seen by a doctor and examined properly to rule out any acute or chronic complications of the disease.

input: Hi, my name s Allie. I m 16 year old and recently went to the doctors to recieve birth control . The pills prescribed to me are called Generess Fe, and the doctor gave me those because since I m petite (only 95 pounds) she thought a higher dosage would cause me nausea & Bad side effects. Since I ve started the pill about 5 days ago, it s giving me bad nausea, even though I take it before bed. When I waleup I can t even move or I feel like I ll throw up. Will this side effect end? And if so, how long will it take to go away? I really hate being sick & there s no signs of my nausea going away:(
output: Hello Allie, I am Kathy - a nutritionist- and I may be able to help you with thisNausea is a common side effect with iron supplements. There are other iron supplements that are gentler on the stomach, and you may want to discuss this with your doctor. I am assuming you are on iron because your iron is low. You can increase your iron naturally by eating high iron foods such as raises, spinach, molasses and, if you eat meat, red meat is high in iron. Eating a source of high vitamin C along with your iron will increase the amount of iron you absorb, so fruit, vegetables are naturally high in C as is vitamin C enriched juices. Iron should always be taken with food. From what it sounds like, you are not eating with it. Try taking it in the am with food (but not dairy or high fiber foods) and include a source of vitamin C with your iron supplement. Food does decrease absorption, but if the iron is making you nauseous, eat and/or ask to be switched to a gentler form of iron. In summary, take iron in am with food low in fiber and a source of vitamin C. Check with your doctor about these problems and see if there is a gentler form of iron you can take. Increase your iron in your blood naturally by including high iron foods. High iron foods should be combined with a source of vitamin C. Have a Great Day!

input: Hello, my 2 and a half year old daughter has had vomitting and diarrhea for a week and a half. I took her to doctor and he said it was probably food poisoning. For some odd reason, began to only throw up very early morning til yesterday. Then two mornings ago my younger daughter threw up and hasnt since. I started to not feel good yesterday morning. Now I have same symptoms as my daughter. Vomitting and diarrhea that is very watery yellow.
output: Hi, It seems that as you all have same symptoms of having gastrointestinal infection, there might be having food poisoning due to taken contaminated food. Consult your doctor and go for treatment of this infection of all. Take light food like curd, rice, buttermilk. Take plenty of water and ORS liquid. Ok and take care.

input: Hi there. I don t use meth but I have in the past and suffered various acne issues. Currently however, I tried using legal stimulants and energy drinks to help me stay up for a new overnights job. (mistake!!) About four days ago I had a minor issue where I picked at an area directly between my eyes, on the bridge of my nose. If it helps any, essentially i thought at the time I was popping, individually, a cluster of zits and I probably pursued this to the point where I was squeezing hair follicles or my pores or something, but obviously the surface of my skin was scraped off in that small area before I came to my senses. The resulting wound is about the size of a iris of an eyeball and you can see little bumps which I assume are my pores exposed. Well, I am in the food service industry and this resulting strange type of wound is awkward and it s likely grossing people out. I realize not using the stimulants is the cure and that s completed but i d like to know what non-prescription medications or ways to treat this are most effective or also maybe common things people try but ends up making it worse- for example over-washing with harsh soaps or the traditional picking. One last thing, each day when after I shower if i even run a towel over the spot, the scab-type tissue which has softened up in the water will completely and painlessly wipe off, leaving it looking much much better. But since it four days later I m thinking that every time i do that I m simply starting all over again. But i tell ya, the scab on this particular thing gets ridiculous looking and so its very tempting to use the towel to smooth it back out. Please help and thanks!
output: Hi try guard or eurozone ointment for early healing. Stop picking at the scab.u r delaying the heading process. Thnx

input: I went to an abortion clinic and took a pill in the clinic yesterday. I was given 4 pills to insert vaginally....Im now having second thoughts! Can I just not take the vaginal pills and continue with my pregnancy or is it to late? The pill I took was Mifeprex 200 mg..
output: Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Mifepristone is known to have adverse effects on the fetus, and one is not advised to continue the pregnancy after its consumption. However, if you want to continue the pregnancy, you should get a detailed anomaly ultrasound at18-20 weeks to rule out any congenital anomalies. Hope you found the answer helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: I had a hard lump above my navel, and severe stomach cramps the lump moved reminded me of a babies limbs movement inside as I could see it move I had bowel movement after this but was in a lot of pain, I had been eating a lo the previous couple of days!
output: Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a cyst (a sebaceous or a gelatinous type), a fibrous or a lipoma. These lesions can occur anywhere in the body and have the tendency to recur.  Management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi,I am a 35 yr old male and i was diagnosed with pericarditis resulting from a viral infection in aug 2009. I was then placed on an NSAID, naproxen 250mg twice daily which sorted out the problem. However, the pericarditis has re-ocurred about 7 times in the past one year and as a result, i am constantly on naproxen 500mg twice daily. I need to know if this medication is doing my body any harm and also, if i can continue exercising by playing squash. Also, i need to know if there is a permanent cure for the condition and if it can lead to more harmful situations like stroke?
output: Hello, You should stay at bed rest as long as you are ill. NSAID is the first choice for pericarditis treatment but when it happens more times (seven times), I would go with another treatment like corticosteroids. There is nothing to do with stroke. You should see your cardiologist for changes in treatment and echocardiography evaluation. You should take rest. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Diet needs a close attention while treating typhoid fever as it may relapse, if not taken care of. Generally during fever, a bland diet, which is smooth and soothing, is preferred. Care should be taken while cooking food and also choosing foods that are easy to digest. Fluids in the form of tender coconut water, barley water, electrolyte fortified water, fresh fruit juice, vegetable soup, buttermilk and water can be given. Begin with semi-solid diet for a few days and then gradually include fruits like bananas, watermelons, grapes and peaches. As the appetite gets better, semi-solid to solid foods can be given. Boiled rice, baked potato, baked apple, yogurt, vegetable soup can be given. Gradually, by 3 to 4 weeks, normal diet can be restored. The following foods to be avoided:1. High fiber foods like whole grain cereals and their products like oatmeal, whole wheat bread and raw vegetables in the form of salads2. Vegetables like cabbage, capsicum and turnip as these can cause bloating and gas.3. Oily foods, spices and seasoning like pepper, cayenne and chili powder to prevent aggravation of inflammation of digestive tract. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.

However 4 years later I am 22 and my teeth are still crooked.It takes a toll on my confidence and I get conscious about wearing braces. I cannot afford invisalign as it is too costly. The only options that I think I have are lingual braces or veneers ,wheat should I do?
output: Did you achieve the treatment objective and the teeth got crooked. If so, retention was not followed. On the other hand if the treatment objective which was explained to you has not been accomplished, then you need to talk to your doctor if any third molar eruption might have taken place or any abnormal habits that might be stopping the achievement of the treatment objectives

input: My friend was receiving chemo during stage 4 of breast cancer. Living with her son, they were instructed to not get pregnant. His wife found out that she was already pregnant. His mother died 6 wks before their baby was born. Living in denial, they had him tested 4 months ago & he is 3 yrs old with autism. Is this a direct result of living with a chemo patient during pregnancy?
output: The exact cause of autism is not known, but research has pointed to several factors: genetics (heredity); metabolic or neurological factors, certain types of infections, and problems occurring at birth. In your child, environmental factors may also play a role. Studies of scientists have found abnormalities in several regions of the brain, which suggest that autism results from a disruption of early brain development while still developing in the mothers' womb. Other autism theories suggest:- immune theory -antibodies that attack the brains, causing autism.- abnormalities in brain structures cause autistic behave- abnormal timing of the growth of their brains.  I want to propose you 1 thing-check his blood for It B6,B12, Folic acid, homocystein. I had positive results with treatment child Chat Doctor.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My wife is a 8 year cancer survivor. Her most recent PET Scan showed a suspicious area near her pectoral muscle region which lit up on the PET Scan. She has 1 small cluster 3.4cm. How can this be determined if this is cancer or not? What would the treatment options be if it was confirmed to be cancer? Can it be surgically removed?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many signs and symptoms of cancer depending on the organ involved. In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall. If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied. Cancer cells and non cancer inflammatory cells might be seen on PET scan. It is suggested that in a 3.4 cm area the doctor does a CT guided biopsy and then the diagnosis is confirmed. If confirmed to be cancer then surgery is possible. Please do not worry.

input: Hello. I am a woman 27 years old. 125 lbs and 5 foot 7. I have been taking Zoloft 100mg per day for about 3 months now & just started on Sertraline 50mg one a day for about 4 days now. I noticed about a 4 months ago my heart would beat really hard one beat like every 10 sec (i was just standing at the park when it happened) . It was almost to the point of being painful. This happens every now and then. I noticed it happens mostly when I lay down for bed. When it happens I get really worried & scared. But im afraid im overreacting. Every time I get my pulse & bp taken, it comes back perfect. Any thoughts?
output: Hello, Zoloft and sertraline does not have any role in heart rate. You can go for a serial ECG is required to rule out any cardiac arrhythmia. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care 

input: Hello doctor, My 3 year old daughter has been having fever ranging from 101.2-103.7 since friday. I took her to the doctor and they founf nothing wrong with her. she has also been vomiting. The doctor said is a virus but i feel is gone on for roo long. What should I do?
output: Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Your child has fever and vomiting, this could be due acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. In my opinion, you should give syrup of lox (5ml =50 mg) 5 ml three times a day for 3 days, paracetamol syrup for fever and syrup risperidone 4 ml for vomiting. If child develops loose stools, then you should also start ORS solution regularly. Review back after 2 days. I hope this will help you. Take care. Regards: Chat Doctor. 

input: I am 28 years male good helth i fell pain in chest near heart from last 1 year its comes when i am laying down for bed at night
output: Hi. Gastritis with reflux symptoms can also cause pain similar to primordial chest pain. I have been diagnosed with these. But not before taking an ECG and cardiac evaluation. It makes sense. It is better that a cardiac pain is ruled out... Hence, I would suggest you to get a cardiac evaluation done too, just to be on the safer side...

input: I have been having an intermittent pain in my upper left chest about five inches above my nipple and approximately an inch or two to the left of it. Is this a sign of something? It has been off and on for about the last three days, occurring every 20-30 seconds
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Left sided chest pain must be evaluated for cardiac cause first. So better to get done ECG and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry about heart disease. Musculoskeletal pain can also be the reason. So avoid heavyweight lifting, strenuous exercise and movements causing pain. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Apply warm water pad on affected site. Don't worry, you will be alright. First rule out cardiac pain in your case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: hi  my brother daughter passes stool in pale yellow when we done tests it has shown high levels of bilirubin  doctors suggested to go for a hida scan baby is 5 months old hida scan says that it is suggesting biliary artesia noe they have suggested a liver biopsy we have done it we are waiting for the result.metabolicreports are normal plz suggest me
output: Thank you for consulting Chat Doctor I'm sorry to hear about the condition of your brothers baby. Biliary amnesia means the normal passage of bile from liver is impaired. The bile gives the normal color to the stool hence the stool is pale. The bile which cannot pass into the intestines get absorbed into blood and causes bilirubin level to rise. The liver biopsy study is done to rule out any pathological conditions affecting liver proper. The treatment of biliary amnesia is mainly surgical. Surgical correction method is decided by the level of amnesia. Please revert with further details like the complete HIDE scan report for commenting further on the mode of surgery required. Thank you.

input: hello .I was diagnosed with mrsa three weeks ago .was treated with Bactrim both pill and sream .I have had severe headaches that continure to this day .I also have felt like crap flu like symptoms .no fever .had catscan .my fear is that ist has not been defeated and that it could spread to spine and brain
output: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. MRSA is the staphylococcus bacteria. It can cause variety of infection and symptoms. Headache is one of the symptoms of the disease. I advise you should continue your current treatment. You can in addition do culture and sensitivity from the organisms. MRSA has wide resistant pattern. So once we have sensitivity we can take the antibiotics accordingly. Please do not discontinue half treatment. As MRSA than never responds to half treated antibiotics. Once cured you have to clear the MRSA from the system. You can use mupirocin ointment to clear MRSA from the system. Apply it to the groin, umbilicus, nasal septum etc. After applications for a week you can do swab testing for MRSA from this area. If you are free from MRSA its good otherwise it requires another round of treatment until you are cured. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor

input: my daughter (9yrs old) was bit by a street dog on 5 may 2011 and the wound was not cleansed as we dont know .rabies vaccine and TT were given after half an hour of the bite. on 7 may 2011 immunoglobulin (400/-) was given at the site of the bite. she has taken 4 doses till now 8/511, 12/5/11 and 19/5/11. after the third vaccine she got fever and leg pains. she taken medicine (p-750  1/2)for fever and some antibiotics as suggested by the doctor. how far she is safe now ? and she got fever (99 0 F) after the 4 th dose taken on 19/5/2011. how long the fever will be  if it is the side effect of the vaccine? and the dog (as per her) is well.
output: Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern for your beloved daughter. Since she has already received FOUR doses of anti rabies vaccine on the days 0,3,7, & 14 following the dog bite and the street dog according to her found to be healthy even after 14 days, she is protected against rabies.Besides, she was also injected anti rabies immunoglobulin at the wound, so there is nothing to worry. The anti rabies vaccines are generally found to be safe, side effects like body ache, fever can occur which can be managed by giving medicine like paracetamol to reduce the body temperature. Another possibility is she might have developed wound infection resulting in fever and for which antibiotics were prescribed, let her complete the course of the antibiotics and paracetamol the fever will subside soon. Hope to have answered your query.

input: I am currently recovering from the flu. Today has been much better, however when I stand up, I get a sharp throbbing pain in the occipital region of my head. When I sit it gets better but not by much. Id say that its moderate sitting. What could it be and how can I treat it?
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms could be related to the viral infection or occipital neuralgia. Although it is not typical of occipital neuralgia that the pain is triggered by standing up position. Intracranial Hypotension could cause such symptomatology. Anyway, I would recommend having some rest and taking plenty of fluids in the next days. A close monitoring of your blood pressure is also necessary to exclude low blood pressure. But if your situation does not improve, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a physical check up, a brain CT scan and a complete blood count for anemia. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, 

input: My adult daughter broke two of her toes, one was a complete break. This occurred 4 weeks ago and she is still experiencing significant pain (not constant but enough to make us wonder if she is healing properly). She has no insurance and had the bad toe set at hospital emergency room. Should we see about trying to get to an orthopedic doctor and see if she may need additional treatment (this will have to be paid out of our pockets and we do not have a lot of money). Thanks, YYYY@YYYY
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor After going through your query I concluded that your daughter got fracture of her toe nearly one month back. By now it is likely that her toes must have united. Now she needs exercises of toe and analgesic for pain relief. Vitamin B, vitamin C and calcium supplements will promote healing. You can take analgesic such as ibuprofen. You can take vitamin B-complex and C to promote healing. Furthermore, you can discuss with your Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link:https://www.bit.ly/ask Chat Doctor. Take care.

input: My mother has a chest infection and has grown klebsiella. It is sensitive to cephalosporins, quinolones, and amino glycosides. She is on cefpodoxime plus clavulanic acid. Herbsputum has changed from green tomyellow iver the past four days while on antibiotics.Is this cephalosporin appropriate to treat klebsiella? Would doxycycline be more appropriate give the fact that klebsiella devolpes resistance to cephalosporin relatively quickly. How quickly I am not sure. She has not measured her temperature, but says she feels clammy.Thank you
output: Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. See, the sensitivity depends on the culture. If the klebsiella is sensitive to cephalosporins then Cefuroxime would help good. There is no need of adding doxycycline to her. In fact, if her fever responds well to this antibiotic, let her complete course for at least 7 days. Some doctors also prefer to give treatment for 14 days. If her fever doesn't responds then adding a quinolone like Levofloxacin would be an appropriate decision. This is my personal opinion for you based on available details. If you have any further query please ask me. Stay HealthyChatDoctor, MD

It has been three days and my throat is the sorest today and I ve developed a nasty cough as well. I feel generally ill and depressed today. I was exposed at work where an individual went outside to spray paint a small piece of plywood and then came in with it before it had dried and may have given it a few touch up sprays inside as well.

input: I have undergone a kidney stone surgery four days ago via urerthal ballon dilatition. One small stone was removed from the left kidney. There is a stent inserted for atleast 3 weeks. My question here is Will smoking Pot will affect my kidneys or stent inside me?
output: Hello In my view smoking is harmful to anyone and in your case its more dangerous. Post surgery your wound healing process take some time with right nutrition, rest&vitamin supplements to encourage college formation it will be more quick.Whereas, smoking,retard wound healing through impairing tissue oxygenation. If the oxygen supply is effected you will have slow wound healing and may even cause bacterial growth as Nicotine causes blood flow to slow down by constricting the vessels. To prevent all the possible complications my advice; if I were you treating doctor would be to avoid smoking at least till you recover. Hope your question is answered.

input: No energy - fatigue Had severe diarehha for two days and ate very little. Have dark stools, but they are no longer watery. Have eliminated nuts, berries and raisins from diet thinking it might be from diverticulitis.

I feel slowed, am 66 years old and have had history of colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure and high heart rate. My last colonoscopy was October 2014.
output: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that dark stools are very concerning about a gastrointestinal hemorrhage (related to diverticulitis or any other disorders). Your past medical history for diverticulitis and colon cancer could be related to these symptoms. But a common viral gastroenteritis as the cause of this symptomatology can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your gastroenterologist for a careful physical examination, an abdominal ultrasound, a stool analysis, some lab blood tests including: a complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, CEA, CA19.9 (tumor antigens), etc. A GI endoscopy is necessary to exclude possible lesions of the digestive tract if suspicions are raised. Meanwhile, I agree with your decision to temporarily reduce the antihypertensive Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi, I m a 26 year old male. Was diagnosed with bulging discs at l4/l5/s1. At times I have had severe pain in lower back radiating into my hip, all the way down to my big toe. Recently, due to physical therapy, I have been getting better. So because I ve been getting better, I ve started to more exercises so I can get back into some kind of shape. But about a week ago, after doing sit-ups I felt a sharp pain from what felt like my tailbone into my anus. Since then it hurts to sit or to do certain movements . At times I feel pressure in my anus as well. Could this new pain be caused from further bulging of my discs or is it something else?

I am currently having it and it feels like when i take a deep breath in something is clamping down on my heart getting ready to burst, i felt a bit light headed and faint but my mum said that was a bit of a panic attack, ive taken a nuerofen but i am still in a lot of pain, and i cant take deep breaths in, ive googled it and found some theories, but i want to know how to get rid of it?

input: my brother aged 55 years is suffering from suspected abdoman koch but same has not been clear from USG ans CTscan and thereafter leproscopy has been advised before starting treatment and no medicine has been advised so far so kindly advise us what should be next course of action in this?
output: Hi, Thanks for asking Chat Doctor. Wish you had details of other investigations as well, then it would have been easier to answer. There must be some findings indicative of abdominal Koch that is why doctors have advised laparoscopy to make sure before starting medication. It seems Until they are very sure they will not start any medication as it has a long course, and it is harsh on patients to put them through all this medication without confirming diagnosis.Also, they may be planning for biopsy at the same time to confirm the diagnosis. Be assured they are doing their best. Good luck.

input: sir, my mother has breast cancer with bone metasis patient.  while she taking chemo and radiation her legs were not properly working and her sugar level is 500. after taking insulin now she has 250 sugar level.  what is the reason for leg swelling and not walking?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Your mother has an advanced stage of breast cancer and needs treatment targeted to the cancer spread. In this situation, the cancer cells might be controlled by chemotherapy and radiation. Her sugar levels are high and this can cause additional health problems during her treatment. Swelling of limbs might be an emergency like deep vein thrombosis. You should urgently consult her doctors and get a D dimer blood test and lower limb Doppler scan done to know if there are any clots in the deep veins of legs. This is an emergency and must be considered first. If she does not have DVT then the swelling of leg might happen when there is extra fluid collection in the limbs and this takes place in the tissues below the skin and is also called subcutaneous edema. Such a situation might arise during cancer treatment and due to diabetes or reduced kidney or heart function and needs to be treated. Please do not worry.

input: I had multiple staph infections on my hands after a bout with an upper respiratory infection. Now I have a phlebitis in my upper arm on my bicep it is now going farther down my arm. It would also be important to note that the staph infections were all on finger joints. I was able to keep them drained but there was one on a knuckle and the last time I drained it it felt like it went down deeper than the others. Now the index finger is swelled at the bottom were there was no cut. Does this sound like I need to get antibiotics to fix this issue. Thank you for your time! And any help is appreciated!
output: Hello, While an occasional infection is inevitable and not a cause for concern, recurrent bouts of various infections should definitely be investigated. In my opinion, you should undergo some tests like Blood sugar test, to make sure you are not diabetic and a complete blood count with your white cell counts and differential counts, to see if there is a problem with your immune system. Additionally, if you are on long term steroid therapy, you could also be prone to infections. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Move fingers fully with pain, can t move wrist in circle without excruciating pain or up and down and side to side
output: It appears that you have sustained a soft tissue injury from the force of the trauma. I would recommend rest, ice and pain control. For pain, You can try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti-inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux. You can also try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24-hour period. You can take both Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen together. If your symptoms do not improve, or you have increasing pain, swelling or redness or numbness or tingling that's not improving, then please see your primary care doctor or go to the ER to have it evaluated. Please let me know if that was helpful. Thanks!

input: Hi! I dont know if this is neccessarily a health question, but I am singing a solo for my high school choir performance this sunday, and at least 500 people will be there. Although I have done this many times before, I have never done it in front of this many people, and I get extremely shaky, my breathing becomes shallow and I get horrible stomach butterflies, which can really affect my singing in a negative way. Is there any beverage or food that I could take before my performance that would force me to not be shaky or have butterflies?
output: Hey dear not to worry about your performance it will be the best of your life. There is no such beverage or food that can increase your confidence unless and until you build it up in your own mind. Your own mind is the best solution for the problem. First you think as if you are singing in a lonely space with full of greenery everywhere & nobody other than birds & trees to hear you. Once you will pick up the grip & people front of you will start to respond you in positive manner you will automatically gain the confidence.Don't think that you are short of breath you are the best. Else you can have a proper psychological counselling session. One more thing you can do is you can just have fresh lime water just 30 minutes before your performance & you won't face any problem.

input: I had a fall on Sunday in the bathroom and I still have pain in the back near the spine.  There is no pain in the bones but seems to be a sharp pain in that area.  I am taking Diclofenac tabs and applying gel.  But the pain doesnot subside.  I have difficulty sitting down and getting up.
output: HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctorI have gone through your query. During fall on back you can possibly get a muscle strain or ligament sprain of back or a vertebral injury like disc bulge. An examination with orthopedic will give clue for that and an X-ray followed by MRI if needed of Lumbosacral spine should be done to confirm that. I usually prescribe NSAIDs like Diclofenac muscle relaxants like Thiocolchicoside and neurotrophic Chat Doctor. After a rest of short duration of 4-5 days I advise physiotherapy also. Hope this may help you. Let me know if you have any further query.

input: My 5.1 year old boy (only child)  has been suffering from very high temperatures and delusions specifically at night. He has a cold and is also on antibiotics for an ear infection.  Two nights ago he had an episode where his body jerked uncontrollably. Today he awoke with painful legs and cant walk and can only stand if on tip toes.  We went to the doctors today who seemed to think that maybe Samuel is play acting for attention.  Although Im obviously open to the fact that this suggestion may be the case it is very unlike him as he normally gets on with things until he is really ill and, having often doubted him in the past and ended up in A&E a couple of times, Im worried to ignore it.  He complained of sore legs when we lifted him for a wee in the night and he is still not walking now - is that a long time for a 5 year old to keep something like this up consistently?  Id really appreciate your opinion

Since I was 16 I felt turned on wearing pantyhose during mastabation, which is a rough surface, but I reached climax all the time. How do I ejaculate in sex with my wife?

input: "me and my boyfriend use to have phone sex...he wished to do sex with me....during that he told me that he want more sex..while masturbating it takes more than half hour to ejaculate the sperm...one day as we planned ready to have sex,i gave him oral sex,then within 5 minutes he ejaculated sperm,the other day same thing happened,when i asked about this to him he told that the hot inside my mouth is the reason.... pls tell me that is that my problem???i frequently have hot body temperature...is that normal???pls tell me..."
output: HelloThanks for query. Based on the fact that you have posted your boyfriend ejaculates within 5 minutes when you give him fellatio (Oral sex) whereas takes long time when he masturbates. Ejaculation is a point of climax of sexual stimulation and is due to contraction of Bulbospongiosus and Pubococcygeus muscles of penis which get triggered by stimulation of glans penis. This stimulation of glans penis being more in oral sex is the reason for early ejaculation than in masturbation. It has no relation with the temperature inside your mouth. Chat Doctor.

input: Hi, I have a broken tooth that had cut my tongue maybe two days ago. Now my tongue is swollen, my throat is severely irritated, the right side if my face has swelled considerably and my sinuses are a complete mess. I mean constant nasal drip while still feeling totally stuffed up (and when I use a tissue the only thing that comes out is like a clear gelatin-like substance), my eyes are partially swollen, red and somewhat leaking. So did all of this spark from a cut on my tongue or is the real issue the broken tooth? (by broken I mean that a small chunk of my tooth has chipped away) Furthermore, the tooth has been this way for sometime but I do not always have these same problems. In others words I will be totally fine for a period of time and then every once and a while this happens.
output: Hi, Thanks for asking the query, Pain and swelling in the tongue is due to trauma caused by the chipped tooth. Sore throat can be due to bacterial or viral infection, swelling on right side due to sinusitis. I would advise you to visit to an ENT Specialist and get complete checkup done and take treatment for sinusitis. Apply colonel ointment topically over the affected area on tongue. Take saline water gargles 3-4 times a day. For broken tooth go crown placement , restoration depending upon the condition of tooth. Hope this helps out. Regards....

input: I m wondering if there are different brands of Orencia. I used to get my infusion at the hospital, but they no longer do it so I go to a clinic. My infusion in April was the first at the clinic and I feel it did not work. I m hoping it is just the bad weather here in New England. I am stiff and achy and tired. My fingers get stuck. I ve never felt like this in such a short period of time after a treatment. I go every 8 weeks. I started at once a month.

input: Hello! So I have had throat stones appear in my tonsils but they have been appearing more so recently. Also, just since yesterday, I don t see any of the throat stones in the back of my throat but I am still having the bad breath smell symptom from them. And in the back of my tonsils, if I press my finger against the crypts, a whitish/yellowish colored substance oozes out of the crypt. Also, I have had these bumps on the very back of my throat for a few days and just passed it off as an irritation due to an allergy. I am beginning to worry that something is wrong with my tonsils. Do you have any advice or suggestions as to what may be going on? Or what I should do?
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The yellow discharge could be a pus from the infected tonsil. It can be secondary to the tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. Consult a ENT surgeon and get it treated. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. The halitosis is because of this problem only. Once you get the tonsils treated everything will return to normal. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

output: Dear Her, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Your count is low and motility is also less, so you will need to get a Color Doppler study of Scrotum done, to rule out or confirm varicocele which could be the cause for this. For this you will have to consult a Urologist who will advise you. You can certainly become a father after proper treatment. Do not lose hope, have a positive attitude. Wish you all the Best.

input: Hi , i am 33 year old male and have been diagnosed with OSMF , although I didnt abstain from chewing pan masala immediately after the diagnose , and kept eating until 3 months back .I have now completely quit chewing the Panmasala.My mouth opening is about two fingers I.e 25 mm with very moderate tounge coming out of the mouth10 mm the serious issues revolves around my third molar which is coming out and the doctor is unable to get to the impact area of extraction due to mouth opening issues , I have been going through this for the past 2 years , and the pain is there occasionally , but now I have finally decided to get it extracted , but the doctors are unable to do so , the pain when happens is unbearable and I am unable to eat during the peak pain period , it happens usually once in a couple of months ( the pain wasnt that bad when I used to eat pan masala).I have consulted a lot of oral maxilofacial surgeons , and they arent sure of how to go about it , some suggest general anesthesia , until I saw a laser treatment for the same , where in they will do the laser treatment for OSMF and once th mouth opening is achieved the third moral can be  extracted easily ( they say 10 days total and post treatment pysiotherapy)My doctor in the interim has not given any injection but a medicine SM FIBRO 2 tab daily ( multi vitamin).Is this the correct course , and will it help achieve the desired mouth opening to get the third molar extracted any time soon .Please advice .ThanksAtul
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The OSF can be treated with Erbium Chromium Yttrium Scandium Gallium Garnet (Err:YEGG) laser which shows promising results. Consult a good oral maxillofacial surgeon and get it treated. The SM FI BRO is an Antonio, the dose you are taking is fine. You can take this for 15 days to a month. Once the mouth opening is achieved you can get the wisdom tooth removed. Even under general anesthesia, your mouth opening will be this much only so you can't get it removed till you improve the mouth opening. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: My 4 year old has had a fever for  3 days, ranging between 99 and 102.9. She complains of a tummy ache and she is coughing. Is lethargic but is more talkative and playful in day 3. She has ate little in the past 3 days, withe the third day the most shes eaten. Takes in some fluid. Complains she doesnt feel well.
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It is quite common for it to pain after severe cough. Do not worry. It seems to be a viral illness.  Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500 mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards - 

input: i have a cyst on the base of my penis shaft... the doctor said it was not threatening and to just leave it alone... i cant very well leave it alone when trying to have intercourse... there was no pain originally but now has started being sore to movement and to the touch cant tell if its getting bigger or about to rupture. should i get it removed?
output: HelloThanks for query. You have what is called as Sebaceous Cyst over base of the penis. The skin in genital area is rich in sebaceous glands and hence prone to get more sebaceous cyst due to accumulation of sebum beneath the skin. Normally they fade away without treatment however they need to be treated if increase in size or get infected. Please consult qualified General Surgeon for clinical evaluation and further treatment. If needed it may need to get excised in Toto (Completely along with the sac) Chat Doctor. 

input: Hello. My sister is 23 years old and is suffering from very low HB that is 3.5. Two years back she had severe bleeding due to fibroids and after that she s on medication. Her bleeding has become better but her HB has fallen down a lot. I am really worried what to do. Should we go for a blood transfusion.
output: Dear patient. Greetings from Chat Doctor !!!  I am Chat Doctor and shall be answering your question. I can understand your reservations about blood transfusion and when it should be done. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem. Your sister has an HE of 3.5gm/DL. The normal HE for her is 12gm/DL. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroid, nutritional, menstrual loss. HE of 3.5gm/DL is a very low hemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence, I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HE till 7gm/DL. She can then be treated for the cause. She can then be given hepatitis, intravenous iron and treated for fibroid if any. Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence, you shouldn't worry about that, I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me. Yours sincerely, ChatDoctor.

output: Hello;welcome to ChatDoctorMTPill kit is prescribed for abortion, and it works but in very few cases there can be failure to expel all the products of conception and in such cases D & C is required. So please consult your Gynecologist and follow her advice and if the products are not expelled even after another course then you will have to go for a curettage. Thanks

input: Why does my breathing feel limited now? Ive only had one panic attack . But I mean that was weeks ago, and now my breathing feels really limited, also when standing up for a while I start to breathe a lil harder. My heart rate is fine now that I have learned to sort of keep calm but now my breathing feels limited & in the middle of my chest and inder my left breast feels a little sore, should I be worried?? Btw im 18.
output: Hi and thank you for asking. Usually it is normal that during or after a panic attack the person might feel breathlessness. You explain that after you now have learned to sort of keep calm your breathing feels really limited. To rule out lungs problem you can do a blood count test, a chest X-ray and a Spirometry test. If they come normal I do not think you need other tests to do further. Thank you Chat Doctor.

It looks like she has had a stroke. took her back to the er yesterday and her bp was 218/151. they got it down to 181/105  and let her go home. What should I do?
output: Hello, Thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor ...* Brief Answer: she should be on regular medications for hypertension. Short information about progress of weakness.*Explanation: My opinion is that high blood pressure on many occasions is an indication for control. That happens on many levels. First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure. Then, Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that does not help, medications are a must. That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities. Some Chat Doctor. Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started. Weakness or neurological deficit in a hypertensive patient is a dangerous sign and need to be managed as soon as possible to avoid brain hemorrhage suggest my patients the following : lower blood pressure to a reasonable level, follow up conscious level and weakness. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other comorbidities like diabetes, hyperlipidemia etc., also you didn't mention the fate of weakness or investigations done.*Conclusion: I suggest you consult your physician about your aunt antihypertensive medications.  If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your aunt good health.

input: My son was hit in the head three years ago with a tree limb causing his first seizure. Now at age 38 he doesn t use but can his right hand. He just recently went to the doctor an they diagnosed him with having MS. However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed.
output: I read your question and I understand your concern. To be honest I am very puzzled by your story, especially the corticobasal ganglion degeneration (CBG) part. CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed. I hope things work out for the best.

input: hi i had an open myomectomy 8 months after delivery and i was advice to wait for a year before trying. it looks like i am preg five months after . will my stomach explode or burst open?. i am so worried but really want the baby because i am 39 and a half . please help i had 3 subserus fib remove that weigh 600gs. this was done in germany.but i am fine no pains or scars except that i had a nerve punctured  and my lap was not responsive for almost 4 months but is ok now but for few itching.
output: Hi, there is increased chance of uterine rupture After mastectomy if you become pregnant soon. So, to heal the scar, 6 months to one year gap is recommended.  But as you have got pregnant, be a little aware that after 8 months starting, you should be cautious of any pain in abdomen.  Visit a doctor immediately if pain is there. Baby will require delivery by cesarean in most of the cases. Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: Hello i got poison ivy exactly a week ago and the rash seems to be at its ugliest stage now.

Ive used zanfel and my doctor prescribed me a strong steroid cortisone but now my groin area lymph nodes are also swollen and hurt so I think it might be infected. :/
output: Hello, Thanks for the query. Zanfel is some herbal product. I cannot exactly say how effective it will be. You need treatment with, oral steroidsAnti histamines are also must.

input: My girlfriend is running a 111 heart rate. She is a diabetic and has a doctor appointment for the 17th and an appointment with cardio on the 19th. Should we be concerned about her waiting for the appointments with her heart rate running so high? Also has had a few chest pains on occasion but they go away.
output: Hello, I have gone through your question. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. As such I need more information on symptoms of your girlfriend. But if she has chest pain and heart rate of 111,you should get her ECG as early as possible, because in diabetics, heart disease may be deceptive and may have milder symptoms with high heart rate. So I suggest you to go for early check up, however it may turn out to be minor condition, but first we must rule out heart disease. My best wishes. Chat Doctor.

output: HIT hanks for using Chat Doctor Adderall is a psycho-stimulant and its therapeutic doses improve performance on working memory tests in normal functioning individuals, and it is effective in both narcolepsy and major depressive disorder.

input: sir, my uncles age is 80 years. sufferring with prostite problem and doctor kept separate pipe for urinating. from that day he is not taking any food and taking only juices and surviving on glucosebottles only.at present he is sufferring with loose motions.please suggest any medicine for fast relief please.
output: Hello, As I see the history it looks like the aging factor and also some infection in the body. Since he is having loose motions this is due to the heat in the body. Which is good to allow it to pass on. Of course, there will be a fluid loss but too much heat in the body may not be good for the physiology to function. As prostate cancer does not lead to multiple troubles unless and until the grades are higher. This can be helped with medication and if required surgery.  Also, you need to monitor the heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation levels. Giving external oxygen supply through the oxygen saturation machine will be of benefit to help further. Control of blood pressure and blood glucose levels is also advised. Make sure he doesn't develop any respiratory issues as that may make him weaker. Giving a good diet which is kind of Grace will be easy for absorption and also giving electrolytes will be good to have some strength. In bed, do some passive physiotherapy to help the muscular system to be active. As this plays a good role in be Chat Doctor.  Also, see to that the catheter is removed after 2-3 weeks of time as this may not be good for the physiology to continue for a longer duration. Chances are heavy on the side of infection. Take the medication as prescribed by the doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In

output: Hello, I cannot answer your question because I don't have sufficient information about his specific epileptic disorder. You must speak to the doctor about the REASON he is having such problems.  Sometimes it is possible to retire the medications if he has been seizure-free for a period of at least 2-3 years.  It doesn't sound like this is happening.  Stopping the fits means your doctor should be able to tell you EITHER the underlying cause to his episodes OR the doctor needs to find another combination or another DOSING regimen of medications that can control his episodes.  Also, you can help your husband by making sure he is well HY Chat Doctor.  You should also make sure with the pharmacist that your husband is not taking any other medications or EATING certain foods or beverages that can NEGATE the effects of his medications to control the seizures.

input: I have been suffering from an abssess tooth going on 2 1/2 weeks.  I am scheduled to see a specialist on Thursday for a root canal; however I have developed a blister the size of a penny on the roof of my mouth.  Is it okay if I burst this blister?  Its is causing a lot of pain.
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the blister that has caused to you is due to pus formation below the root tips of the infected tooth which at times perforates the bone and appears as a blister below the soft tissues. It is a painful condition, but you should not prick or burst the blister as it will be further painful. You should take antibiotics like Augmenting 625 mg three times a day and Tramadol 5Omg thrice a day and Pantoprazole 4Omg empty stomach once in morning.... You can apply numbing gel over the blister for local relief. You should continue with the medicine for 5 days and by then get the root canal started so that the pus finds a way to discharge, and the condition will relieve. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

output: Hi Defender, For the discomfort that you are having in the abdomen, you must consult a doctor and get a detailed examination done, including ultrasound scan and if indicated gastro-duodenoscopy to diagnose the cause of your abdominal discomfort. Once the cause is established correct treatment can be instituted. Twitching in the abdominal muscle and eyes may be due to calcium deficiency. If that is the case you will require calcium supplement. Wishing you all the best.

output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be related to an inner ear disorder. What is your age?

Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions, Chat Doctor.

input: Like the 20 year old guy below, I also have a small, hard bump more than a lump on my collarbone. It is more like below the skin and I can grab it. It does not hurt. Im curious because I found another similar small bump on my right shin. Im 51 and very healthy. What are these hard bumps?
output: Hi. My opinion is that any lump should be investigated. It could be a lipoma, but these are usually soft and benign, but we need to exclude other aggressive tumors. A biopsy will give a definite diagnosis. I suggest you see a doctor who can assess and advise further. I wish you good health.

input: i have herniated discs in my neck as a result im used to my arms and hands going numb no feeling and dropping things at times. But the other day which this has happened a few times my left fore arm locked up while washing my hair it hurt and also was numb my concern is could this be a sign of a heart attack or stroke?
output: Hi dear, When a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. Pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. Symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. Weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. So i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. Not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. Patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. I will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.I may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, I can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice I have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.I hope you will carry on with the treatment .TAKE CARE.

input: I know of a 14 year old girl who is frequebtly urinating in school and bed wetting. It is causing social problems for her. She has been evaluated by a urologist, but no cause was found. I suspect abuse or neglect by the parents. Is this a likely explanation?
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. I have few questions for you -1. Has this kid stopped bed-wetting at certain age and again started having it2. If so at what age she stopped and when did it started she had never stopped bed-wetting form birth...you can try some behavioral changes which I can elaborate after proper history and interaction with you, but the effect will not be immediate, but it will be permanent. If it's a recurrence after attaining nighttime control, I suggest you see your pediatrician to rule out pathological causes like urinary infections or Voiding dysfunction. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome.

Drinking lots of water but nothing seems to ease the pain which is not constant but lasts from 15 mins to an hour.  Cannot find a comfortable position when the pain comes on.  I recently completed a 40 day ChatDoctor diet.

input: MY BP is averaging 183 / 130 since the beginning of the new year. I have resumed taking meds as there seemed to be no gain or lowering over several months. Have read about the dire consequences of such high BP and am at odds to find a way of bringing it down. The only area of which I am guilty is in the area of worry and stress. which I feel is made worse as we are no longer intimate ...for more than 3 years; and even before sex averaged 6 times a year. Any advice?
output: Hello thanks for posting here. You seem to have got resistant hypertension because your BP is not under control despite being on medications. So we must look out if there are any treatable causes of this resistant high blood pressure. A block in both the arteries supplying the kidneys is on the causes of resistant hypertension. So please do a renal artery Doppler to see whether you have kidney artery disease. Another reason is a condition Called pheochromocytoma. It is a being tumor of the Chat Doctor.  To detect that a CT abdomen can be done. So my advice is first to do a renal artery Doppler and if it is normal then a CT abdomen. Meanwhile, your BP medications should be added and changed. Wishing you good health regards

output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. You might be suffering from viral infection.I would adv you to do a blood test mammogram to see the total leukocyte count. If it is raised >10000/CMM then it is a bacterial infection and would need antibiotic like septum.Otherwise, viral cold infection resolves on its own. Adv-1. Steam inhalation2. Adequate rest.3. Plenty of oral fluids4. Salt water gargles.5. Medications like minaret and Monte LC can help. In case of worsening of symptoms refer to a general physician immediately, as swine flu has to be ruled out. Take care.

input: I have a 21 month old who is constantly teething and congested. Ped says hes  normal. Tonight I heard a slight wheeze when he woke up. Hes been waking overnight at least 4-5 times crying. I have a humidifier in his room on now. Does this seem to be allergy symptoms or pneumonia/bronchiolitis?
output: Hi, If you got him checked by the PED recently, and if he did not mention pneumonia/bronchiolitis, then, this is excluded.  However, I highly suggest getting him physically examined by the PED for further evaluation.  Usually, when having common cold/viral infection, the upper airways are congested and become narrowing. This is associated with difficulty in breathing.  I advise to: - do aerosol-therapy with saline-keep his nose/airways cleared/opened-give him plenty of water/fluids to avoid deny Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi I am 21 years old and i just started having sex a last month. I have used post pill five times and now a Dr. has given me MICROGYNON oral contraceptives 4 cylce to help with my period(which is a bit unstable(timing)) but i am worried about its side effects and i am willing to pay more if there is a better pill for girl my age. i am worried about its level of protection because i dont want to get pregnant since i am in college and also i am worried about its side effects......please help
output: Microgynon is a low dose oral contraceptive with minimum possible side effects. In my opinion, these should not be more than those of any other low dose oral contraceptive. Pregnancy rate with all low dose oral contraceptives is only 0.1% which is the lowest possible rate. So, in my opinion, it can be a good choice.

We tried for conception in march, June and July. Used OPKs in June and July. Will this help while TTtc? Anything we need to be careful about???

output: Hello dear thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. No, this is not the correct way to treat. Old age patient, with bad cough with history of previous pneumonia should be investigated to rule out pneumonia. As pneumonia in old age patient, if not treated early can lead to poor outcome. So I advise you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x-ray.2. Sputum culture and sensitivity to guide antibiotics.3. Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis if sputum is not available It is better to start antibiotics according to sensitivity report to achieve the greatest effect and fasten recovery. So avoid Rocephin injection further and consult pulmonologist and start treatment according to guidelines.

input: I am being treated for lichen scelorsis at the moment. I was told to take a bath everyday. Since starting this my psoriasis has flaired up worse than ever. Its terrible. Im using dobovate cream on it at the moment. do you think the baths might be the cause problem. Is there anything else you would recommend?
output: Hi, As you said you suffer from psoriasis and that is worsened after treatment of lichen sclerosis. You also have doubt that daily bathing is responsible. I would like to say about few lines for psoriasis.... Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing and autoimmune disease. There may be scaly plaques on various parts of the body, scaly lesions on the scalp and sometimes joint pain may be there due to politic arthritis. Exact cause is not known. Genetic tendency, autoimmunitity, stress, Chat Doctor. .etc. may be responsible for precipitation and exacerbation of the disease. You did not say what treatment you took for lichen sclerosis. If your doctor has given oral steroids or steroid injections for lichen sclerosis.that would have worsened the psoriasis. I do not believe that daily bath is responsible. I usually recommend cap accretion 10 mg twice a day along with methotrexate 15 mg weekly in three decided doses 12 hourly. This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. Apply mild steroid cream or calcitriol point on the lesions. For scalp psoriasis, tar shampoo may be done. You may apply moisturizer to improve the skin texture. Avoid soap bath for few weeks. Avoid stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.

input: I have a sharp pain in the middle of the spine. I had a c section 2 years ago and have gained 25 kgs during my pregnancy at it was high risk and I was n bed rest. Though I have lost 20 kgs after that but the back pain lower and recently in the middle of the spine is unbearable. I also haVe neck ans shoulder pain for quite sometime now. I am a working women and most of my work involve working on the computer.i have the pain the middle of the spine at around the spot where I was give an injection for my c section. Pls advise
output: Hi, I believe that a good physical workup should be performed to discover the most likely cause of the localized back pain. It seems that you've lost nearly all the weight you gained during the pregnancy, so mechanical causes of back pain are probably less likely.  Still a good examination to distinguish different types of back pain including the possibility of chronic pain following the c-section is worthwhile and can help identify even other causes of chronic low back.  Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture.  In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hello, Thanks for your query. It seems you are suffering from degenerative disc disease & it occurs due to repetitive overload or stress to the disc & it increases the risk of disc herniation & spinal canal stenosis. The main treatment of such pain is bed rest along with painkillers and muscle relaxants. Muscle relaxants can help with your symptoms if used in appropriate dosage in combination with a potent analgesic. You can get the appropriate Chat Doctor. Meanwhile, you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.- Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.- Avoid exercises in times of pain. - Improvise your posture while sitting.- Using an LS contour belt of appropriate size might be helpful in providing support to back muscles. Also, maintain a proper posture while working, sitting and standing. Keep your back straight. Physiotherapy plays a major role in treating such conditions. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

My skin type: oilyAge: 16Ah so please let me know a good fairness cream which will turn me fair within a month, please DoctorThank you...
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Skin color I genetically determined. Asian skin is type IV skin which contains fair amount of melanin and is prone to tan quickly as compared to Caucasians/ people in the west who have very less melanin. Skin type cannot be changed but regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen gel, which offers protection against both UVB and UVA, can be used to prevent sun induced tanning. A cream containing one or more of the following ingredients e.g. comic acid, glycolic acid, abuts, magnesium absorbed phosphate etc. can be use once daily at night to lighten up the tan and impart even tone to the complexion. Hope this helps you regards

output: Dear user, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. According to your description, there is almost nil possibility to have traumatic injury causing erectile dysfunction in your case. Let me know whether you achieve and maintain an erection in sleep, in the early morning or during masturbation then there is no need to be worried about. It is likely due to performance anxiety. For continuous erection, there must be constant erotic/romantic thoughts, feelings, and sensations in your mind. If your mind is diverted to concern about erection, you will lose erection or have delayed or no erection. This failure causes you worried more during next time and again makes you focusing on your erection rather than enjoying erotic feelings. You may read Senate focus on internet. I suggest psychological counseling with psychiatrist. Wish you good health.

The dentist discovered the problem with the abcess when a new crown was going to be placed, where the original tooth and crown broke off recently.  The dentist put me on a antibotic for one week.   I have a extremly sore neck and right shoulder blade for the past 2-3 weeks, I read that this could be due to the lymph nodes in my shoulder processing the infection from the abcessed tooth.  It is the holidays and my regular doctor is not available.  Should I wait another week to see if the swelling goes down?

input: Hi, the left side of my lower abdomen just above my pubic area feels bruised when I press it. I am not pregnant, and I just started feeling this yesterday evening. My period is 14 days away and I do not remember bumping into something but it might be a possibility that I did. I have no trouble using the toilet, and no pain unless I press against my lower abdomen. I hope you can help! Thanks
output: Hi, Thanks for the query. Pain in the abdomen can be due to various reasons. During the menstrual cycle, ovulation (release of eggs from ovary) takes place around 14 days prior to the start of menstrual periods. Occasionally some people feel pain in the abdomen during that time. Other than that, if you have any other symptoms relating to your bowel movements or urination, those also could be a cause. You can wait for 2-3 days to see if the pain is subsiding by itself. If it does not subside, then it is better to get examined by your family physician. You can also get an ultrasonography of the abdomen done to see if any abnormalities is happening there. Hope I have cleared your concern. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance to you. Thank you. Regards

input: My 10 month old daughter has been sick for the last month now. I have taken her to her pedi 3 times now, and I still don t feel she has gotten any better. It started as a normal cold that seemed to have gotten better after about a week then about 2 days after that got worse in a matter of overnight, so I called the Dr. and they saw her and said it was probably just post nasal drip, again after a few days seemed to be a little better, and within a few days after that got worse again. I took her in again to find she had an ear infection. The Dr. put her on augmentin which she had a reaction to which gave her a terrible diaper rash so I called once again and they changed her med to azithromycin and probiotics. I still see no change in her cough..it is a frequent cough that at times gags her. I am very concerned that she should have gotten better by now. What should I do?
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor . From your history I concluded that your baby has upper respiratory tract infection.

input: Can this be throat cancer?i have been suffering with pain in and around my ear fire about two mos now I saw an ent who said no ear infection I even saw a neurologist who said no nerve damage, sometimes I feel tiredness in my face as well my dentist said I should be checked for tmj I m twenty four and a smoker please help
output: Hi, Why do you smoke when you are so worried about getting a cancer? You have visited an ENT specialist, a Neurologist and a Dentist; none of them have detected any cancer; hence cancer should be highly unlikely. Moreover, your Dentist seems to be suggesting that your ear pain could be due to TMJ arthritis; which could be true. In that case eat soft foods and do not chew on that side for couple of weeks. Nevertheless, you need to quit smoking; otherwise the cancer can catch up soon in any smoker, and you may not be an exception. Sreenivasan

input: My 12 year old daughter suffered from tachycardia a couple of months ago. She is perfectly healthy, active. By the time she was brought into the ER by ambulance from school her heart rate was 205 bpm. She had an ultrasound and heart monitor all results were normal.We found a large amount of mold in her room behind her dresser and under it, could this episode be due to mold exposure?
output: Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious disease specialist, answering your concern. Mould never causes tachycardia. Mould can cause respiratory infection, superficial or subcutaneous infection. Mould has nothing to do with the heart, so it never causes tachycardia. But having large mold at home is serious issue and can cause other health issues.

In long period it can cause allergic reaction to you and your child Chat Doctor. I will be happy to answer your further concern you can contact me here, or you can contact me on bit.ly/

input: For about the last year I have had wheezing.  And it sounds like its deep in my throat - not my chest.  Recently I have developed a metallic taste when I cough or sneeze.  I do not have a chronic cough just seasonal allergies.  My doctor gave me Zegerid because I have heartburn pretty often.  It helped the wheezing the first time I took it.  But I just tried it again and it didnt help as much.  I also have a Dulera inhaler that helps the wheezing.  I am about 40 pounds overweight so I wonder if that contributes too.  Im a little worried about this.  Anything you can give me would be helpful.  THANKS

input: A couple weeks ago, my cousin was injured in a car accident. Trauma to the head and other injuries. My aunt emailed this morning and said: The Emergency room doctor told us that his heart was beating but his brain was dead and all doctors in the room decided to stop to help him. I have two questions which I m seeking an opinion on: 1. If a brain is dead, can the heart continue to function for a long period of time? In this case, I think it had to be 20 minutes from the time of the accident to the time the ambulance arrived at the ER. 2. Wasn t termination of further medical assistance really up to the next-of-kin? I m just looking for a simple explanation or non-binding opinion. Any assistance on this matter that you could extend to me would be appreciated. I have to go visit my aunt on Tuesday and I d like to have these answers so that I go with some peace of mind before I see her and make her more upset than she already is. Thank you for your time and help.
output: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. If your cousin is diagnosed with brain death (there are examinations that determine it, EEG, cerebral and brain stem reflexes absent, etc.) then his heart can beat for an indefinite time if there is medical support, if no heart will stop soon. The time that human brain resists without oxygen is 3 to 5 minutes, beyond this time (without blood and oxygen) happens brain death and if the diagnosis is correct there is nothing to do to help him. Sorry I have to say this. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

input: This is general question. what is laparoscopy? Why it is done? Any risks?
output: Laparoscopy is a surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube put through a cut in the belly to look at the abdominal organs or the female pelvic organ. Laparoscopy is used to find problems such as cysts, adhesions, fibroid and infection. Tissue samples can be taken for biopsy through the tube. In many cases laparoscopy can be done instead of laparotomy surgery that uses a larger incision in the belly. Laparoscopy can be less stressful and may have fewer problems and lower costs than laparotomy for minor surgeries. It can often be done without needing to stay overnight in the hospital. Laparoscopy is done to check for and possibly take out abnormal growths such as tumors in the belly or pelvis, check for and treat conditions such as endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease, find conditions that can make it hard for a woman to become pregnant, do a biopsy, to look whether cancer in another area of the body has spread to the belly, check for damage to internal organs, such as the spleen, after an injury or accident, do a tubal ligation, fix a hiatus hernia or an inguinal hernia, removal of organs, such as the uterus, spleen, gallbladder, ovaries and appendix. Partial removal of the colon can also can be done and also to find the cause of sudden or ongoing pelvic pain. Risks include bleeding from the incisions, infection and damage to an organ or blood vessel. This may cause more bleeding that needs another surgery to repair.

input: Hello . I have a family member that recently had a pelvic exenteration which removed the cancer but recently came back. It is now in the place where her bladder would have been. She has lost a tremendous amount of weight & is too weak for chemo. What other options does she have ?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a challenging condition but must be treated till the end. If your family member had a cancer near bladder mouth then she must have had locally infiltrate disease requiring exoneration. This is a surgical procedure by which most of the tumor and its adjacent structures are removed. Even after surgery, seeding of cancer cells might take place and has happened in her case. If there is recurrent growth of cancer then she must take combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. As you have mentioned that she is too weak for chemotherapy therefore focused radiation remains the most tolerable treatment at the moment, but this depends on the general condition and local recurrence of the disease. Please have a discussion with the cancer surgeon and radiation oncologist and proceed with treatment as per the outcome of discussion. Please do not worry.

input: Lately, I have had an issue of having to urinate more often than usual. Until recently, I would go in the morning when I got up, at night before bed, and maybe once during the day. But now I feel the urge many times during the day. I don t have any problem when I go, no burning or pain, and always a strong, steady stream. But now, seemingly 15-20 minutes after I go, I feel like I need to go again. My bladder always feels full except for immediately after urinating. I have had a problem with kidney stones in the past, and have suspected that may be part of the problem. I m 62 (and I suspect THAT may also be part of the problem) and in fairly good health. I just want to make sure there is nothing more serious that needs to be addressed.

It always happens at night while I am sleeping and I wake screaming and shaking, hitting my arm to make it stop, afraid that I am about to die (if it gets to my heart).  This has been happening for about four years (every few months).Could this be related to B-12 deficiency?  I am a Raw foodist and I have low B-12 and low iron and vitamin D.  I did read something recently that said B-12 deficiency can cause nervous system problems (which this would appear to be), so I ate meat for the first time in many years, but I have stopped as i am not comfortable eating meat, and it seems b12 supplements have more b12 than meat anyway, but now this has happened again and very badly, so I am again uncertain...

You should go for proper treatment- it D supplement: 60K/ week *4 weeks ; then calcium with it. D tablets daily for 4-6 months. For B12- injectable given I'm alternate days - six to eight injections suffice.

input: About a year ago, I had a root canal on a tooth. Yesterday I went to my dentist because I thought the filling had fallen out. Turns out that the tooth was cracked and split in two. The dentist pulled the loose half out. He suggested a crown but said I had to wait until the area heals. Today, the material from the root canal fell out. I called my dental office and was told that as long as it doesn t hurt, I m okay. I don t know what to do.
output: Hello, thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor. Actually when a tooth is split in 2 halves then the treatment depends on two things, if the split is extended till the gums then you have to go for extraction of tooth, as there can be further infection. And if the doctor is asking you to wait this means that the split is superficial, but still if material has come out then you should go for re-restoration. Hope it will help you.

Diet can also be improved with eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, red meat etc. It will help in improving anemia. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

input: A year ago I injured my right hip and lower back from a 15mph fall off a longboard. I did not seek a doctor and over time felt better. I am now experiencing lower back pain after physical activity, which has never happened before. I usually notice it when I lay down at the end of the day and I get a sudden rush of pain in my lumbar section of the spine. If I slowly turn on my side and lay in a curled position the pain will eventually recede. This has been happening for several months and has not improved.

input: My five year old just got real dizzy and fell, I am not sure why. Could it be blood sugar? She had pancake for breakfast with syrup, a root beer at lunch and then a cookie. This has never happened. She had not had anything to drink for the day other than that root beer. Please advise!

input: Hi, for about 4 days to a week I have had a tight chest and a cold feeling in the back of my throat. The chest tightness moves around or even goes away sometimes but for the most part it in the base of my lungs or sometimes a bit lower than my rib cage. Right now its directly in the centre of my chest, It also feels like something needs to be cleared from deep in the back of my throat every so often when I breathe in. I do or did smoke. Ive made a conscious effort to stop but its only been a couple of days. Im worried its something very serious. I have suffered from anxiety for over a decade but Im well attuned to that to identify that it isnt the issue here. At least I dont think it is. This has kind of sprung out of nowhere as I was fine a week ago. Im not under any stress. I thought it might be reflux but I dont know. I do suffer from that also but have never experienced anything remotely close to this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

input: My grandma is 78 she has been in the hospital for almost the whole month of September. She went in first for CHF then for acid reflex and now they just removed her gallbladder . She was in CCU for a few days after that to get her breathing under control due to her CHF, they have her on lacex to remove the water. Any how now for the past few days her right hand is swollen and very weak. Any thoughts She did have 3 blood infusions
output: Did she have IVs or other catheters in that arm? She may have developed a blood clot in a larger vein...a venous ultrasound of that arm would be my choice of test.

input: my three and a half year old son woke up about a week ago with a red ring around the top of his mouth, to where a moustache would be. it was red, and if you touched it, it felt normal, not raised up or bumpy. it just looked funny. we called it his moustache and over a few days it went away. then two nights ago i noticed a weird rash on his elbows,lots of red blistery looking things, and little red spots spread out over his legs and hands and feet. but very very few of them. just the elbows looked bad. those have mostly gone away, but i looked at his feet tonight and it almost looks like blisters on his toes. mainly both sides and around the nail of his big toes. but little spots too, that arent big enough to be blisters i dont think. but its the same thing that was on his elbows.  he also had a fever for  two or so days about 5 days ago. not sure what any of these are, or if they even have anything to do with each other.
output: Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The symptoms seem to be related to a viral rash. I suggest using anti-inflammatory medications to treat the fever such as Tylenol. I also suggest using Calamine lotion for local application. Hope my answer was helpful. If you have further queries feel free to contact me again. Kind regards!  Chat Doctor. 

input: A few months ago I was skateboarding and fell off and grazed my knee. This has left me with a darker discoloration where the scab was, which seemed normal so I didnt worry about it, but about 2 weeks ago two little lumps appeared on it and were quite itchy. Now there are 6+. Do you have any idea what these are? They look slightly like mosquitto bites but theyre not going away and multiplying.. Thankyou
output: Hi, thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor virtual-CLINIC.-In my opinion-You are suffering -mostly from-knee abrasion with scab in the beginning,- which developed later on in 2-6 lumps-with underneath wound infection, presenting with itching.-Multiplication of these itchy lumps may be due to associated Ringworm which developed underneath the scab-this could also be thought of as one of the possibility while treating it.-Consult your family doctor / and skin doctor and investigate to fix the cause of it.-Remedy-Would be with --Tb-NSAID-for 5 days time-Antibiotic with advise from your family doctor for 5 days time.-ketoconazole point locally with good wound care would resolve your knee lump.-If no reduction then review the diagnosis with Surgeons consultation who-would do debridement of the wound and change the antibiotic and would take the care of the knee wound with scab properly.-Hope this would help to resolve your knee-itchy- lump by discussing with your doctor. Wishing you fast-recovery. Wellcome to my Chat Doctor Clinic again. Good night.

input: Hi. I have pain and pressure in the lower part on the back of my head and when I put pressure on it when I lay down on it I get dizzy. And now I noticed even if I m standing up and I look up I get dizzy can you give me an idea of what that is? Thank you
output: Hello dear friend, I can understand that you are anxious about this, but the way you described your complaints, is just not enough to tell you a pinpoint diagnosis. In fact, the feeling of pressure on the back of the head, associated with dizziness(both on standing and lying down)just not fit into the mechanism of the clinical conditions which may cause these symptoms. Possibly, its just anxiety or aromatization. Still, I would like you to get your blood pressure checked in both standing and lying position for a postural Chat Doctor. One step further, i suggest you to visit a neurologist and if he says all is well, then a psychiatrist will help you out. I hope it helps.

input: Hello, I am a 15 year old boy, I have recently noticed in the past year or 2 that my nipples have become very puffy and squishy. I am very upset about this and would like treatment that is (if possible) little to no expense, or a treatment that doesnt involve surgery. I dont think it Gyno becuase my pecs are fine. Is there anything I can do? Thanks
output: Hi, It can be due to hormonal imbalance. Rule out for estrogen and testosterone levels. It can also be due to chronic alcoholism. For treatment, you can use hormone supplements in case of testosterone deficiency. In case of other causes, you can do surgery. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. R. Raveen

input: The last few days I have random quick but intense chest pain under my right breast. I am a 50 year old male in good shape.  It lasts for just a few seconds and then goes away.  More frequent when exercising but does not seem to hurt any more or less when breathing heavily.  Any clues?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take simple painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Can you get thrombocytopenia from a Shingles vaccine? My husband had a normal platelet level in November and then recently had a severely low platelet level. Medications have all been the same. Only difference is the Shingles vaccine. YYYY@YYYY
output: Hello, Thank you for your question here at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern and I want to inform you that the Shingles' vaccine can lead to some adverse effects and thrombocytopenia is not listed among one of them. There are some reports of Poltava vaccine leading to thrombocytopenia, but currently we need more proof and clinical studies to affirm that for sure. In other words your husbands' thrombocytopenia may be linked to the Shingles' vaccine, but we do not know for sure at the moment.Meanwhile, please do not worry as this is a transitory effect and the platelet count will rise to its normal value in around 2-4 weeks if we were talking about minor thrombocytopenia from the start. I recommend another platelet count after 1 month just for your psychological comfort. I hope my answer helped you. Do not hesitate to reply if you have further questions, Best

input: HI I AM TAKING NUCYNTA 100mg ER FOR BACK PAIN. I have also found it to be far more effective than Fentenyal 12mcg patches and as a bonus it is far more effective than Fentynal patches for my peripheral neuropathy. Without these painkillers I would be in constant pain t. I was very careful not to raise my Fentynal dosage over the course of using them for the last 4 years, enduring some occasional periods of pain. My question: is Nucynta more or less effective for long term pain reduction than Fentynal? Thank you.
output: Junta is the first and only FDA-approved long-acting opioid designed to control both pain and neuropathy. Junta is also used in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., fentanyl) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.

input: My Grandpa recently found out, after having over a year of severe lower back pain , that he has an aneurysm . It is 7 cm long but I m not real sure where its located on his body. My question is: What are my grandfathers chances of survival if he gets the surgery recommended by his family doctor; and if he refuses the surgery what could the outcome be as far as time is concerned ?
output: Hai, Low back pain due to aneurysm is often mechanical. The aneurysm has certain other features to determine the need for surgery and vascular surgeons are the best to give you the prognosis aspects.

input: I have known my whole life that something was different about me. I am almost 20 years old and two years ago i went to a doctor to try and get some answers. i found that i was noticeably more hyper than any of my friends, i couldn t stop talking, i would get in these weird moods where all i would do is think about random things, i would tap my foot or leg, feel rushed when there wasn t a need to be rushed, and i would always snap on my parents, sometimes for no reason. i went through perscriptions of concerta , adderall , and vyvanse , just recently upping my dosage of vyvanse to 60 mg. my question is, is it common to feel extremely irritable and angry towards people i care about when i accidentally forget to take my vyvanse? this has always been a question i have. i always feel much more calm and relax and not easily angered or upset when i take my vyvanse consistently.
output: Hi There, thanks for asking. That is true, you should take Vyvanse regularly in order to avoid being jittery or irritable. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has another component which is "impulsivity". Many boys who have attention deficit hyperactivity also have impulsive behavior. For example, they may become aggressive toward their friend, and they feel remorse soon after it. Vyvanse is not only useful for your hyperactivity, but also helps you to manage your behavior. On the other hand, Chat Doctor.  I wish you the best performance at school and in life.

input: My daughter had a nervous breakdown recently,. she was under a lot of stress, has had depression in the past, and added to this was a lot of anxiety. she is on several potent drugs. I feel she is over medicated. she has gained 50 lbs, since being on the drugs. Is it necessary for her to be on prozac, seroquel, ativan, neurontin (which she is weaning herself from) and a couple of others? why would she need to be on so many of these mind altering meds? this episode took place in Aug. with 2 additional episodes after August. she s also in group tx. and one on one tx.
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  She needs to have council ling, and she should have love and affection, as others get. She should be included in your family issues as far as possible.  Furthermore, she must have an occupation, like cooking, and household works with some guidance.  With these guidelines, she can vein off the Chat Doctor.  No psychological patient can improve health without the surrounding peoples help.  Let her practice yoga, meditation, reading books, and hearing music, to have weight reduction and diversion from her imaginary surroundings.  Give her more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to improve her general health.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

input: MY DAUGHTER IS 9 YRS OLD AND HAS A RED PATCH ,VERY SMALL, AROUND 2CM IN DIAMETER ON HER SCALP WHICH IS SCALY AND FLAKES OUT LEAVING REDDISH PATCH. DERMATOLOGISTS SUSPECT SEBORRHIC DERMATITIS/ PSORIASIS AS IT IS NOT GOING SINCE A YEAR NOW. ON APPLYING TRIBEN-B AND NOSKORF LOTION 2-3 TIMES A DAY IT DISAPPEARS WITHIN 10 DAYS BUT REAPPEARS ON STOPPING. kindly tell whether is it psoriasis and am i on the right path.
output: Hello as your doctors suggested it could be either psoriasis or seborrhea dermatitis. It's difficult to say which one only based on a description.

Causes are-recent instrumentation (ERCP), gall stone, billiary enteric anastomosis, pancreatitis,BE fistula, etc.extrahepatic billiard duct dilated means the hepatic duct and CBD are dilated.

I have been getting really bad headaches and feeling slighty sick as well over the last month. Do you think this is something to worry about?
output: You haven't mentioned your age build weight etc. which are important for suggesting something, no back pains don't usually run in families. Try a course of tab Lobar twice daily for a week with local application of Mykolaiv ointment

Since that day I had left side lower back pain and cannot sit on the soft sofas and setting in the the car/driving more than 30 minutes as I would feel burning sensation at my lower back.

input: Ive been getting knee pain for a while in the same leg that i had a tibial nail in some 7 years ago. My quad on that leg has never really come fully back to the size of the other leg. I have an office job, so I m relatively inactive during the day usually, but have had the last 2 weeks off as holiday and have been more active moving some furniture, fixing things around the house, some home improvement and a bit of gardening. This morning I woke IP with a round, painless bruise on my kneecap, near the top inner edge. My knee does grind a little at full extension, but that happens quite a lot anyway. Over the past week, the quad muscle on the affected side has grown and become more responsible, but is still smaller than the other side. The knee is reasonably painful during stress and occasionally hits a big bit of pain when extending under load.
output: Hello, You had mentioned the previous history of trauma at knee and nailing had been done before 7 yeras, so might be that may cause compression and irritation to joint tissue. To rule out we must go for X-ray. Another cause may be due to continuously repeated heavy work, your qua Chat Doctor.  You should walk regularly do cycling swimming running jogging, if the pain is subsiding it means your thigh muscles were weak, or else you need to take an x-ray for the knee joint. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Hem ang S Jane, Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist

He has a cathetrist by the legs for look his heart and also he said the part where was introduced the cable is dark. He is no complaint but went he touch his leg feel sensitive. Sorry my english and thanks very much.
output: Hi, Your father appears to be a heart patient, who is having edema in his legs because of cardiac issues. Dark color of his legs might be because of venous congestion which in itself is a cause for swelling and edema. You need to consult a cardiologist for the same. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: Hi, my mom is feeling strange, she has a rapid heart rate of 104-120, currently at 104, BP was 150/104 now decreased to 149/95, I have given her tonic water and aspirin. She was previously diagnosed with A Fib. I have her lying down with feet elevated drinking cold water and continuing to monitor her blood pressure. Is there anything else I need to be doing right now? Thanks for your help.
output: Hello, I would explain that her symptoms could be related to possible cardiac arrhythmia.  For this reason, I recommend going to the nearest ER service for a physical exam and a resting ECG.  A low dose of beta blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, etc.) if she is taking any of them, would help improve her situation.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am also looking at the option of SEMAS which is a maths program and they say it definatly helps with concentration!
output: Hello, Calmalin does not substitute Ritalin to treat ADHD. I don't think that it might be helpful to treat the symptoms of your son. You should consult your doctor about an alternative treatment. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: sir, i m 22 years of age and having neuro symtopes as 1. feeling of dizzyness and fear , anxiety . 2. sometimes vomitting and nausea 3.hands getting week i had done eeg and it says normal have done mri which says venous angiomia in the left frintal area of brain im little worried if its serious bcoz im a student. plz refer me some medicine.. if ayurvedic den it will b good
output: Dear Normal, welcome to Chat Doctor. Good that you sought timely help. Hand weakness, omitting are cerebral signs and are important if MRI shows a venous Angola. Medicines are not of use.pl. consult a neurosurgeon urgently to see if any surgery is needed soon. If not you could take symptomatic treatment. It all depends on many factors of the Angola. It could bleed and get serious. So take neurosurgical opinion and act on it. Pl. keep me posted on progress. Good luck

input: hi,sir i feel sever pain in my occipital region,n also heaviness in this region while studying.whats d problem ?
output: The headache and heaviness aggravated by studying can be due many reasons. Assuming that you are a student, it is unlikely that you have a refractory error (near vision problems are usually seen in middle age). Association with studies almost rules out other causes like sinusitis and migraine.  When mind is forced to do what it does not like, it will react in such a way that you have difficulty doing it. Headache, decreased concentration and forgetfulness are some problems commonly seen in students. High expectation from self and others only add to the burden. Following points may help you overcome this problem:1. Take frequent breaks in between study sessions2. Make the Studying process interesting (like group discussion, audiovisual aids etc.)3. Take help for difficult subjects(coaching/tuition)4. Plan well to manage time. Remember, "Failing to plan is planning to fail"

output: Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. Following is my reply:1) You have to take anti tuberculosis medicines for 4 to 6 months and then test again to see if you are cured of TB.2) You may have to go for IVF later than your tube seems to be badly damaged due to TB. 3) Please start anti TB treatment soon I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any follow-up query you have.

input: I. Have a small hole below my front bottom tooth. It doesnt hurt at all..dentist wants to cut a piece of gum and sow it. Over the tiny hole.he  said my teeth are very healthy and hes not sure why this happened! Should I get this procedure done or what to see if it closes by itself ?  He took X-ray and tooth is heathy
output: Hello, As you are mentioning that dentist has taken an x-ray, and it is normal this means that the tooth and bone is healthy. This problem can be gums problem. Actually sometimes it happens that when there are two lower labial French (attachment of gums with lower mucosa). They are closely placed and space between them look like hole, it is not painful. In this case do not take tension, just wait for some time and observe if there is no pus discharge then it is normal, and there is no need to go for any treatment. Thank you

input: I developed a cough in December followed a few days later by cold symptoms. Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all. Rib pain is now alot worse again and this is 14 weeks since the illness started. I dont understand why the rib pain hasnt gone and why this cough keeps reoccurring.
output: Hello After reading your query, these symptoms may be due to these possibilities, these include:1 Pleural effusion, diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray chest and blood examination for CBC, ES R .2 Thickened pleura, diagnosis can be confirmed by X RAY chest .3 Asthmatic allergic bronchitis with tuberculosis. Since you are having these symptoms for December and continue for 14 weeks. In my opinion consult a pulmonologist and get his opinion (2nd one). Good luck.

input: My 16 year old daughter started getting her menstrual cycle when she was 12. However they are still very infrequent, about 3 menstrual cycles a year. She has not had one since early February. I have had blood work done and it has come back normal. We don t want to start her on birth control because she is a carrier of Factor V Leiden. Should I take her to a specialist? If so, what type of specialist?
output: Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Irregular menstruation is common in early menstrual age. Factors V Leiden mutation is not responsible for it. But still you should consult your gynecologist once and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer.

input: Abouttwo and a half years ago I noticed that my mother developed bad odour inspite the fact that she is a very clean woman. The smell changes but I woud say it is a chemical smell. She did lots of tests amongst them at the gynecologist and all doctors say that there is nothing wrong with her. Last December she did a knee replacement operation and during her stay at the hospital the smell vanished from home. Before the operation she did a number of blood test and all gave good results. There was one doctor who said that it could be the tablets she is taking for high blood pressure , for cholesterol and for diabetes . He said that it is going to take a while whle they detect what is causing the smell and he changed Metformin. The smell stopped for approx. a month but it got back eventuelly. My mother is 80 years old but still self sufficient. Please do tell me what you think.

input: hello sir well iam a 16 year old girl and ihave been having sex but its only been two days so idoubt iam pregnant yet ihave very strong abdominal pains when iuse the bathroom and ihave been going to the bathroom really frequently yet urinating very little
output: Hello, your symptoms suggest a lower urinary tract infection (cystitis). Sometimes this infection follows sexual intercourse. If you'd like to confirm or exclude this diagnosis then an urinalysis may show increased number of white blood cells and bacteria in the urine and a urine culture may reveal the offending organism. I could not suggest any treatment because I don't know if you have a history of allergic reactions to certain antibiotics or you history in general and also whether you've taken any antibiotic during the last 3-4 months or not. This information is very important for treatment decisions. I hope I've helped! If you'd like more information, please ask and I'll be glad to answer. Kind Regards!

input: my boyfriend woke up last night and he couldnt breathe and was freezing cold. He tried to take a breath and felt like he wasnt getting any air.

output: Hi, It's simple to understand that how asthmatic patients can't or becomes difficult to breath. Our tracheobronchial tree consists of smooth muscle fibers, and any muscle get contracts or spasm with effect on cold and just opposite to warm or hot, it relaxes, if anyone who is already have their tracheobronchial muscles allergic to spasm(like in asthma)and in addition when they get cold air, this smooth muscles begin to contract leading to constriction of tracheobronchial tree turned into unable to get air exchange and difficulty in breathing. Inhalers makes this muscles relaxed or dilatation in medical terms within seconds. That's the beauty of allopathic Chat Doctor. Hope u understand.Goodbye

input: I had a root canal on my tooth (between molar and canine) 2-3 years ago. It was never suggested to me to get a crown after the root canal. Last Saturday, my tooth cracked in half. The front half doesnt move, but the back half moves easily. There wasn t much pain initially. I went to the dentist Thur for a cleaning/exam. There weren t any appointments available until Sept 26 - which is when I was going to have an extraction and prepare for bridge. Last night and today there has been a lot of pain...mainly on the gumline on the side that is very loose. Is there anything I can do now, being that it is the weekend and no dentist is open until Mon? Can I pull the loose half?
output: Hello, Thanks for query, After root canal one should go for crown to safe the tooth and for its long life. But it is not your fault as dentist had not suggested you for the same. The decision of your tooth depends on the X-ray that we could save it or u need to go for extraction. I suggest you to please do not try to remove any part of the tooth and take appointment as soon as possible. In case of pain take analgesic medicine. Vishal JainVitaldent

input: my father in law has had his thyroid removed, has diabetes, has a stint in his heart a bad back and weighs about 300lbs. He had to be taken to the er with shortness of breath, hallucinations, he has had a lot of confusion for awhile but it was much worse. he already took 40 a day lasix. Hehad fluid around lungs and heart low o2 levels. They upped his lasix to 80 put o2 on him. They had to keep the o2 at 15 otherwise his levels wouldnt stay up. Lung infection also discoved. Heart only working at 40% then co2 up to 90and unresponsive. Now on a ventilator co2 down to normal. what is likelyhood of brain damage? Any other input apprectiated. Family is trying to make some hard decisions.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, chances of survival are very less. Rising carbon dioxide level is suggestive of respiratory failure. Accumulation of fluid in the body is suggestive of heart failure. Confusion, unconsciousness, hallucinations etc. will cause brain damage. And this kind of brain damage is permanent. So his all major organs are failing. This is not good sign. If you remove ventilator, I don't think he will survive. So family has to take decision about taking off ventilator. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father-in-law. Thanks.

My endometrium is in proliferative phase. after AMH test result is 1.92 i.e. low fertility. My right fallopian tube is well outlined upto its fimbrial end and shows good peritoneal spillage. the left fallopian tube is not visualised beyond cornua. no obvious spill is noted on left side. i take the following medicines - Clomipure (50) - for ovulation, M2 tone 2tablets twice a day, Myotol F 1 tablet daily and ovigin D 1 tablet twice a day.

input: 26 year old male with no STDs or any other health issues. Masturbated and tightly gripped the base of my penis while doing so. I gripped really hard. Before ejaculation I let go and ejaculated like normal, but felt an odd somewhat dull pressure/pain on the dorsal surface of my penile shaft about 1 inch above the base (traveling in the direction of my penis, i.e. not horizontal/diagonal). At the area of the pain was now a hardened cord with a bit of a bump at the middle of the cord. It is not visible but can be palpated. It seemed like my penis took longer to become flaccid after that. I stopped any masturbation and let it rest for a week. It seemed nearly better but masturbating very gently caused it to return somewhat. I have gone a bit more than a week without masturbation now but want to check that something like this will go away and not be any long term damage. I still feel a dull pain at the area at times when the penis is flaccid. No issues with erections or ejaculation. Is this a lymph or vein issue? Will NSAIDS help or is there anything to help with lymphatic drainage/healing? Have I done long term damage?
output: Hello I share your concern, I will try to help you out in the best possible way. Looking at your description this could be STI or infected ulcer may be due to trauma during masturbation or an allergic reaction. I would like further information help you better relevant medical history like metabolic disease or hormonal disorderly recent exposure to unprotected sex? You should ask your doctor for few investigations to confirm the diagnosis like Urine culture and sensitivity test Blood for CBC and liver function test or urine test are advisable if it is a chronic issueNSAIDS like ibuprofen or acetaminophen will definitely help you Maintain good hygiene Wash and clean it with antiseptic solution or soapbox can apply antiseptic ointment externally. Use condom during sex if you are sexually active Hope this answers your question please feel free to ask for more clarificationThanks and regards

My husband and I want to conceive as we have established our careers and are ready for our first child. I am 40 years old. What is your recommended treatment for this?
output: Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. The chances of you conceiving naturally with all these problems are very less. You must list an infertility specialist to get evaluated for galactorrhea and get treated. Though fibroid is small, ovarian cyst needs to be evaluated further and diagnosed as to type of cyst & necessity for removal. You may try with donor egg option. Either ways you need to consult an infertility specialist. I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any followup queries you have.  Chat Doctor.

J stent was putting renal unit. You have pain in abdomen at the same site. This is either due to urethritis that develops after ESL and stenting the ureter.

And later on switch on to appropriate antibiotics as per culture report. Ensure to Chat Doctor. 

input: I am having chest muscle twitches on a reg. basis on the left side of my chest. Had a serious shoulder operation in Feb to repair a rotary cup. No rotary cup present so operation wasn t quite what it should be. I am 75 and my guess is that I have pull a muscle from trying to rehab my left shoulder which is almost impossible. My question is how can I control it somewhat so I can take a nap in the afternoon or go to sleep at night.

Also do exercises that specifically involve your pectoral muscles strewing and strengthening like holding hands backwards, shoulder shrugging,

input: Hi,4 years back incidently doctors found one pulmonary nodule on my right lung on chest X-rays. They asked for CT and the result shown 1.5 cm size. I undergo Bronchoscopy also, but didnt show any problem then. But after these long years I am having on and off fever. Agin asked for Contrast CT. and the result shows that the nodule grew to size of 2.6 cm. and am asked for bronchoscopy again. The first result of bronchoscopy showed on reading like 18HU. is there any possibilty of malignancy. Or is there any risk with that nodule.
output: This is likely a growth of some sort, whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) can only be definitively determined on a biopsy. The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth, or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granuloma being the cause of this nodule. TB (tuberculosis) or fungal infections of the lungs can do this. I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for.

input: My creatine level in February 2013 was o.53 with eEGFR Rate of 99. All other baseline tests were normal except for microscopic hematuria. I am 68 now with pseudomonas bacterial UTI that hasn t gone away even with ciprofloxasin. June 2014 creatine level was 0.9. Using same formula as used in 2013, the eEGFR rate is now 66!!! Same lab says Less than 60 indicates chronic renal disease. I know of NO risk factors (drugs, lifestyle, toxins, hospital care) that would make this happen. I look and feel very good.But the UTI isn t going away. Just saw my doctor, cystoscopy scheduled. He was not concerned.Any reason eEFGR could go down so fast??? (I am doing heavy contructioin work in my house.)
output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You should not worry about that.  You may have urinary tract infection. Repeated urinary tract infection may be due to diabetes.  You should check your blood sugar level. Heavy exercise can also cause this.  So don't worry about that.  Repeat your creatinine level and EFR level after a month. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: Hello, I wanted to know if I have infection. I had a foot injury about two weeks ago and I have swelling. Since yesterday I started having an itch and I wanted to know if this is infection. I have blisters on the top of my foot and I still have a lot of swelling and bruises.
output: Hello, An x-ray is advised for the safer side to understand the pathology of the bone if it may have got any damage. Because if there is no cut or wounds then the chances of infection are maximum less. This must be a bony hurt which may have damaged the soft tissues around it. Also, the mechanism of the injury may have helped us to understand the injury better. I will advise to hot water fermentation, do feet, toe and finger strengthening exercises which can be performed under the water and lastly to keep the limb elevated so the swelling reduces, and the venous return is improved which will help the healing process to occur faster. But please make a note to take an x-ray of the foot in the AP and lateral views. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

input: hi i have had a blood test because i have red eyes and a bloated stomach,and my test came back with my c reactive protein at 6.5.I suffer from pain in my abdomen and have had scans wich show i have kidney cysts in my right kidney,which they will not touch as im only 31.i am fed up of this after two years and have been told they are all seperate please help
output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Your other symptoms have no relation with your kidney cyst.  Treatment of cyst depends on size and location of cyst.  Small cyst can be treated by conservative way.  Large cyst need to be treated.  Many options are available.  Aspiration, decorticating or surgical removal are the treatment available.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Decrease the salt intake in your food.  It will reduce the blood pressure and reduce the burden on kidney.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

I just wanted know whether it is good to give my son the syrup. Whether it will cause any side effect. Do my son really suffer from Iron defecency so he is not eating ???
output: Hi, the syrup name that you have mentioned contains iron and is an iron syrup which is given in child Chat Doctor.  Iron syrup should not be given without proper evidence of iron deficiency anemia.

input: I received a birth control shot about a month ago because I am sexually active and dont want to become pregnant. The doctor had told me that there would hardly be any blood with periods and the cramps would almost be nonexistent. All of yesterday I had horrible cramps, the blood was a bit darker than usual, and there was what looked like a piece of skin with the blood. This has never happened to me before, and I was wondering what it could be.
output: Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. The main mechanism by which a hormonal injection acts is through suppression of ovulation. An ovulatory cycle are painless and that's why your Chat Doctor.  Generally it takes some time for the hormones to act as they are administered externally, and the body takes some time to get adjusted to this hormonal imbalance. So, they may not be effective in preventing the ovulation in the very first month. If the ovulation has occurred already, then hormone injection will not prevent the fertilization but will certainly prevent the implantation. The tissue you saw could have been the expelled fertilized ovum. Also, heavy bleeding and delayed periods are common in the initial few months. If your period had been a little delayed following the hormone shot, then the tissue could be endometrium which is thickened when there is delayed period. If the bleeding persists and if you pass a lot of clots, then you should seek your treating 

input: Hi, I believe I have pericarditis due to cat scan and primary said so but cardiologist did noyt say for sure what it was but did no firther tests to determine. Fam doc put me on steroyds,,, twive and came back each time. Cardiologist wanted me to take motrin or alege but I have colitis and it disrupts my system. Do you have any further insite you could share with me. Maybe I should get another oinion? I felt horrible last night and the room was spinning while my heart has twitching and hurting....did not know what to do, esp when I broke out into a bad sweat? I am tired of this.
output: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. About 90% of the causes are unknown. Most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. Pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. Some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. I am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. The work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as EKG changes. The first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. There are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. Steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. Generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. You should also get plenty of rest.  Some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. You should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. If you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, I would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle.

input: I tried for a child last 1 year bur could not succeed. All the reports are normal. My doctor advised me to take an injection Fertigyn 10000 mg. on my ovulation date for conceiving child. Is that injection helping me for conceiving? I heard that by taking this injection, chance of conceiving twins or more is increased .Is that true? Pls help me or advice should I take this injection or not.
output: Hi, How are you doing ? Just by taking In. Foreign you cannot get twins or get pregnant. Foreign is hormone LH, which is released from brain. This hormone will only confirm ovulation, only if the follicle of right size is available. Twins can occur if stimulated by Tablets like Camphene (Closed or CCQ or Sphere) & follow-up stimulation with HMG hormone injectionsThese hormones have no abnormal side effects, so it is safe to take it. Just go through the checklist of investigations, if you have missed any do get it househusband- Semen analysis at least 2- done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center (examination done by an Chat Doctor.  So check with HSG(X-ray with dye), or SSG (Scan with dye) or Laparoscopy all this done & found normal, nothing can stop a pregnancy with Gods will Hope I have cleared your query, do write back if anymore queries the best

input: Hi I noticed a lump bigger in my right breast than in my left, but I do not know what kind of lump is bad. I am 18 and I know it is very rare for it to mean anything but I have been feeling very sick lately. Sick to my stomach and my neck, back, and all of my joints have been hurting very very bad for the past few days. I have been getting headaches through out the day, and I do not know what is causing this. There is no way I could be pregnant.
output: Hi.it is best if you consult with a physician, preferably a general or a breast surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Benign breast lesions (such as cysts and fibrotic changes) usually occur when there are hormonal changes (i.e. before during menses, pregnancy, etc.). Breast ultrasound may be initially recommended. If lesions are found, diagnostics and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

input: Erythroplakia, I am trying to decide after two years of trying steroid treatment if I need to have the lesion removed.  The surgeon made it sound like it was pretty common.  I am confused as to if it is really necessary to have it removed or just to live with it.
output: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Erythroplakia lesions are of more concern since they are considered precancerous. In your case the surgeon is probably doing the best way for you, as removal of the lesion will be the first step in it. Taking the whole growth is more advantageous, because if it turns out to be malignant, the doctor has already taken the first step in treatment by removing it. A pathological study of the specimen with determine whether it is precancerous or cancerous, such that it can be monitored better. Relax and go ahead with the procedure, though you can always take a second opinion from good surgeons. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards.

output: Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, would examine you clinically to exclude any tenderness (pain on pressure) on the right side of your abdomen, and look for any other signs to rule out appendicitis. If I could rule it out, I would like you to be examined by a gynecologist colleague. At the same time, I would get your routine blood check up done like a CBC, Blood sugar, urine routine and microscopic test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen if need be. Further management would depend on the results of both clinical examination and investigation reports. Till that you might go for an anti-spasmodic Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

output: Hi, If he don't have any other symptoms like severe headache/vomiting/cough/throat pain/neck swelling, we can take this as a viral fever with lymph node enlargement in neck (although it is uncommon in the middle back of neck) causing local inflammation and pain. Try giving him ibuprofen syrup(100 mg/5ml) 7ml three times a day after food. If he is not getting better by then, kindly take him to doctor for further evaluation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care 

input: hi, my son has gone through this surgery in 2005, but its size is like before,(very small),but urinal problem is cured. i want to ask that when the size& shape of penis will be normal? at what age? is there any problem? does he require any other surgery for the size to be normal.?
output: HI based on your history, I can infer that your child got a Urinary infection for which circumcision was done. No need to worry about the size of penis as it increases only after adolescence by hormonal effect. The important thing to look for is, the ease with which he is passing urine. Hope it answers your query

input: Hi, my grandmother recently had gall stones removed. She had the surgery a week ago tomorrow and is still experiencing extreme amounts of pain. Additionally, she seems to be having symptoms similar to a urinary tract infection - burning and constant feeling to urinate. Is that a symptom involved with gall stones or the removal thereof? And to add more to all of it, she has been having diaherra for over 2 months. Her doctor precribed her medications for this which help when she remembers to take them, but it seems to be an ongoing issue for her - even more so after the surgery. I m worried that my grandmother may have some other issues going on that the doctors haven t found yet. Can you help shed some light on any of this? Thank you!
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. This is rarely caused by gallbladder surgery unless there was bladder or ureter injury. But it would be reported. It is more possible reinfection which is common in people that underwent any surgical procedure since their immune system is weakened few weeks after surgery. She should treat it by taking the lot of fluids and antibiotic if necessary. Diarrheas may be experienced after gallbladder surgery but it shouldn't last for more than 2-3 months. If there is no improvement she may need gastroenterologist work up to rule out some bowel disorders. Thanks for the query. Regards

Sir whether this can be cured with medicines else need surgery. If it can be cured by medicines, pls advise the medicines that I need to take. Thanks for the help.
output: Hello Your findings suggests mild fat deposition in liver(fatty liver) with enlarged prostate. Fatty liver is a reversible condition. Fatty liver can be managed by diet control and exercise in the majority of the cases. Fatty liver may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, obesity,altered lipid profile, medicines etc. You may need few blood tests like random blood sugar, routine hologram, lipid profile. You should avoid saturated fat and take plenty of fibers in diet. You should increase your physical activity and go for exercise regularly. Simple cyst in liver is age related developmental finding. It only need to follow up if it is asymptomatic. Mildly enlarged prostate need clinical correlation and further investigations.PSA(prostate specific antigen)should also be assessed in enlarged prostate. After clinical evaluation, you may need medicines to take like alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor. 

input: My son is 15. He has had fever for 6 days. The fever has ranged from none to 104.5, with most days around 102. My doctor says its a virus and to wait it out.  He is extremely weak. No symptoms other than weakness and loss of appetite. The doctor has done a flu test, strep test, and blood test which revealed a high blood cell count, but thats all.  Advice?
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Appetite loss and weakness or malaise is very common in the recovery or convalescence period of viral illness. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness only. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

input: I am 25 years old and my husband and I have been trying to conceive for 7 mths now.  We have had his sperm checked, I have had a HSG done, and everything was clear for the both of us.  My Prolactin level was at a 36 and my doctor wants to get it down to a 15.  He prescribed me Cabergoline which I have been taking for 2 weeks now and I will go back in another 2 weeks to have my levels checked again.  I have always had a regular cycle with mild cramps, nothing out of the ordinary and have never missed a cycle since I first started at age 11.  How worried should I be about conceiving and how long does it take for this medication to work?  Any advice?????
output: Sorry about your difficulty getting pregnant. The high prolactin for me is not an issue, since you have a regular menstrual cycle. Yours might just be a case of unexplained infertility and so your attending physician is trying to optimize your hormones to increase your chance of conception. You might need to take the Chat Doctor. * I am blowing baby dust to you... Hope this satisfies you, if not I am willing to give more help. Cheers.

input: My name is Tuan Kamileen Yaheya, 60 years of age, height 5ft 9 inches and 73 kilos in weight. Last Thursday afternoon I started to sneeze continuously and when I reached home two hours later, I had fever. I took paracetamol to fight the suffering. Next day I consulted a doctor who after a thorough external examination prescribed a series of drugs to be taken for two days.Even though four days have lapsed I still continue to have a prickly pain in the body, and a lack of vigour. I feel drowsy and lethargic. Please give advice. Thank you
output: Hi, From history it seems that you might be having viral infection giving sneezing, body ache, malaise. This will remain for few days. Take ibuprofen, paracetamol combination medicine for 2-3 days as and when required. Take some decongestant, anti-allergy medicine like Monte LC. Take plenty of water. Take complete rest.

Went to the doctor and she gave me some oral medicine to swish, a nystatin..but my mouth does not look like thrush at all..the area is sore and tender.
output: Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of blisters on the roof of the mouth which is mainly due to canker sore, cold sore, dermatitis and could be production of acid. Need not worry. I would suggest you to Chat Doctor. 

input: Hello. I was on Beyaz for a around 3 weeks and had un protected sex. I was also on azithromycin for 5 days. I did get my period on the time I was supposed too. I started my new pack of pills on time and everything was fine. Well on the 3rd week I messed up and skipped two pills. I had to restart a pack and now have been spotting for over a week. Help!
output: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy. Missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up.  This is the bleeding you are experiencing now.  It most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. You maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day.  A way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee.  Carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,

input: Hi doctor, I am 10weeks pregnant my doctor did the scanning and said that baby is good but there is some blood clots for that they gave ChatDoctor inj and said that next week also will give . I had an history of miscarriage in the last pregnancy hence they gave ecosprin, duphaston medicines so far. Now they told me to stop ecosprin and they gave duphaston twice a day and folic acid tab with first dose of ChatDoctor inj. Doctor m waorried a lot about clot will it be clear by taking of ChatDoctor injection plz clarify me .
output: In Chat Doctor will not clear the clot but in Chat Doctor will prevent uterus from contracting and prevent abortion. Ecosprin helps in preventing spontaneous clot formation in blood vessel. Ecosprin is stopped now because as younalready have developed clot that means that you had some minor bleeding so by stopping esprit further bleeding is prevented. Duphaston will also keep the uterus in relaxed state and prevent abortion. Folic acid prevents brain abnormalities in baby (neural tube defects).hence folic acid is given

input: Hi Dr, I have a 5yr old daughter and soon i will be giving birth to my second baby (boy) i never in my life taken prevention tablets or injection and i am scared to start now. my hubby and I have decide that this is our last baby and i want to insert a loop. Is it possible that they can insert it immediately after giving birth? Is it safer? should i wait a month or two after giving birth? Please advise. My e-mail add is:- YYYY@YYYY
output: Hi, inserting an intrauterine device after childbirth is usually done around 6-8 weeks after birth. Because the uterus is back down to it's normal size then. The doctors won't insert it directly after birth - as the uterus still has to shrink back down to the normal size and any intrauterine device wouldn't be" held" by the uterus. Most women won't have sex during those 6-8 weeks - as you are still postpartum - having postpartum discharge which is first red and slowly turns a different color until it stops after about 6-8 weeks. You can usually talk to the doctor at your postnatal check-up - or just after the birth so that the insertion can be organized for you ahead of time.  Hope this has helped. Kind regards, JR

input: My grandsone was dionosed with cancer when he was 16, he went to Johnson city childrens hospital..we need his records so he can be checked again he will be 21 in May,,,no one seems to know where they are, He also went to Pittsburg, Pa childrens hospital...How can I get his records so he can see if he is still in remission?
output: Dear bumblebee, You can see your primary physician who referred you to Johnson Hospital. If you don't find the record with him, you could give the tentative date of your visit to Johnson hospital Medical records section who could find your grandsons record. If this does not help you the health authority who maintain the National cancer register, visit them and telling them the tentative date of of completion of your grandsons' treatment they might be able to give you the records. As regards whether your grandson is in remission you can visit your primary physician and apprise him the history of your grandson, he will perform necessary investigations on your grandson and let you know his present status.

input: Ive had an upper respiratory infection and I was taking antibiotics and steroid, Finished steroids yesterday and today I feel like im tingling all over my body. Almost like nervous in a way. Could this be from the medicine or should I go back to the doctor for revaluation. Im still having respiratory issues, from allergies.
output: Hello rearward welcome to Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query in details .* Steroid is an immune suppressor and reduces inflammation.* Once you stop the consumption of steroid, body takes certain time period to produce adequate levels of natural cortisol, due to which there is tingling sensation in the body.* So there is no need to consult doctor for tingling issue, but for respiratory issues have to consult doctor if annoying. Hope this will help you for sure . Wishing you fine recovery. Welcome for any further guidance. Regards .

If it is hepatitis A or hepatitis E, then no need for further testing, and it will recover in two to three months. If hepatitis B or C then repeat the test again after three months and six months to check for carrier stage. Until two to three months, avoid high fatty foods, trans fat foods, and pizza etcetera.

input: My husbands Semen analysis report is like Volume=2.5mlReaction: AlkalineViscosity: ViscousTotal Sperm Count: 45millions/mlMotility:     Rapid: 10%     Progressive:20%Morphology: 40% NormalWe are trying to conceive from last 6 months and no success till date.Im having early bilateral PCOD and under medication of metformin 1000mg/day. After having medication my period cycle is pretty normal now. Is there any serious problem to conceive?Thanks
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. You wrote about the values of the seminal analysis of your husband. Whether your husband abstain from sex at least 3 days prior to seminal collection. It should not be more than 7 days. Then only the results will be more reliable. As per the present result, the motility of the sperms are not adequate to make you pregnant, and regarding the morphology, more than 70-80% normal sperms constitutes a good quality of semen. It may be due either infection in the reproductive tract or may be due to varicocele etc. Physical examination and presence of pus cells will confirm the cause. You have to ascertain whether your ovulation is regular following the treatment for POD. If all problem attended with due care then there will not be any problem for you becoming conceived. Wish you a happy family way ahead. Chat Doctor. Morgan

input: Im an 18 year old girl and I have constant lower abdomen pain. First it started mostly on the left side,now all of the lower abdomen hurts. It hurts even more when Im walking or when Im in bed laying on the side or sitting with my knees up and pressed together. It hurts the least when Im laying in a straight position. This pain has been going on for about 8 days now. Now I did have unprotected sex 2 weeks ago but it was the day after my period ended and I took the morning after pill straight after so it is not pregnancy. Thank You for your help
output: Hi, Having a constant lower abdominal pain might be related to: - urinary tract infection/or other problem - genital infection-bowel problems advise running further tests in order to determine the right diagnose: - urine analysis-vaginal swab testing-abdominal ultrasound- examination of stool for ova/parasitesDepending on the tests results, specific treatment will be prescribed. Meanwhile, I advise to: - Chat Doctor.

input: My son had a blister on his big toe about 4 weeks ago. Since the blister has popped we have been unable to get his skin back to normal. He s had 3 deep cuts on his tiny big toe and the skin feels very rough like a callus. A couple of the cuts look fairly deep. We ve been putting medicine and trying to keep band-aids on his toe to get it healed. How do we get him back to normal? Should we be concerned?
output: Dear Sir/Madam have gone through your query and read your symptoms. In my opinion, you should be concerned and need to consult an or tho doctor early, as only by seeing the condition one can judge the magnitude of problem and thus provide you with appropriate solution. I hope that answers your query. If you want any more clarification, contact me back.

input: I think my boyfriend ins passive aggressive. He came after me the first day of school. after our first date he never called back, then he stopped comig to school, then he d show up. sometimes he d say hi, other times he wouldn t look me in the eyer when he spoke. Then I invited him back to my apartment. He didn t make love to me he didn t kiss me, I saw his face, he made as effort not to get into it. I m really attractive so I knew something wasn t right. He admitted to me that he wanted to tear me to pieces when he first saw me because he wanted me so badly. It s been up and down. He wants me but he plays these strange sulky games. I m confused. Also he has had 2 dui s and a felony for breaking in to beat up his sister s boryfriend. He is highly intelligent, a student as the Uof I. But unable to connect emotionaly. He has grandious ideas about becoming a politician and says that is why our relationship must be a secret. I m 14 years older than him. I know something is wrong with him but I ve never come across this type of behavior.
output: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  To know more about him is the only way to find what is troubling him. I rather say that as he is intelligent (in your opinion) he is playing safe. You have the capacity to understand him. As he is an aspiring politician, as he says, he wants to keep himself away from affairs, which might trouble his future. That is a good opinion. At least he is focused towards his future. Things like flirting and having sex is not his concerns. He is much more matured than that. Understand him and adore him. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

input: Ive been getting serious chest congestion that last up to 7 days too two weeks every now and then. About a year ago I got bad chest congestion that lasted up to two weeks. It got better and I went on with my daily tasks, about 4 months later I got terrible chest congestion again, I got better within two weeks again. So a year later I got chest congestion again, it lasted one week. About a month later (A few days ago) I got bad chest congestion again, it gets to the point where I cant walk Im so out of breath and Im worried that it might be more then just chest congestion, I do have severe allergies. And it gets bad sometimes when the mold is high. Im wondering do you think I might have COPD or any other serious condition?. Im young and I dont smoke. My family doesnt have a history of diseases so Im at a loss.
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are having severe allergies, possibility of asthma or allergic bronchitis is more likely for your symptoms. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). N acetyl cysteine (NAC) is also beneficial to relieve congestion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: I am a 58 year old Black Woman and Im having a hard time breathing, I ve never had asthma or any other pulmonary disorder. I am currently off my diabetic medication because I don t like the side effects, however, I have not experienced any trouble breathing until recently. I can stand to lose 75 pounds or so and I am 5 7 inches tall. Can you give me a clue?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Since you are diabetic and not taking treatment, your diabetes must be out of control and very high. And uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease like hypertension, angina, heart failure, coronary artery disease etc. Other risk factors along with diabetes are1. Old age (age more than 55)2. Post menopausal status. So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. Uncontrolled diabetes can also affect lungs. So get done chest x-ray and PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to rule out pulmonary causes. So consult doctor and discuss all these and get control over diabetes.

Serum electrolytes. The pain in the calf and ankle may not be related to the present problem and needs special examination by an Orthopedic Surgeon.

input: Hi My mother who is 80 does sit lot,when sitting her legs turn red from the feet up and are swell up also..With the redness she has pain..What I would like to know if this is caused by the heart..She does have heart problems..Just about to forget she also has heat with the redness and shinny legs. Sorry to take up your time I thought this was free..Can t afford 15.00..Thanks anyway
output: Hi your mothers condition is caused most probably by weak heart pumping action which leads to accumulation of fluid in the legs and feet. This part is below the heart and gravity contributes to this also. In addition, she may be having a partial block of the veins which take the blood away from the legs.  She sits a lot which is not good and should walk around and use elastic stockings which help this to some extent. Another important thing is a check-up by your doctor to see if the veins affected are the deep ones or those near the skin. Medication will be needed for this. Keep the legs elevated while sitting, and she may do ankle foot exercises to aid in pumping of the blood. You are most welcome and hope this is useful for your mother. Please take this advice free

output: Hi pain in the groin is very common after catheterization, you can ask your cardiologist to prescribe you with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like diclofenac and seratiopeptidase for a few days. If erection does not happen after 5 days of treatment also then pudenda nerve injury can be suspected, in that case test have to be done for investigating damage to pudenda nerve supplying the penis.

You should get your husband semen analysis before starting your procedure. Hope I have been helpful. Regards

Can I have loosend or broken the screw? I m a 67 year old female in very good health.
output: Hi welcome to ChatDoctorYes due to yoga by the twisting any or uneven pressure effect could be the cause of displacement of disc. Yes there might be loosened and when it gives pressure to spinal nerve you feel pain. As the unset is sudden and just after a few days of yoga postural movement, so those chances are maximum. But if it had been a long day gradual origin then we should think for others factors like osteoporosis or any spinal growth etc. The exact cause can be found out by CT Scan of whole spine. Thank you

input: I am feeling this pressure on my left side, and its there almost all the time. I did have a CT done a year ago and the doctor said then my liver was enlarge. Now Im feeling something there aall the time. Thanks Jonathan
output: Hi welcome to the Chat Doctor Liver was enlarged before one year in CT scan. Hence, evaluation needed this time again, and you can simply get investigated with USG abdomen According to cause further specific treatment given If liver still enlarged then investigation needed with bag detection, anti HCV detection like further investigation Alcohol history also should be ruled out If USG normal and Liver not enlarged then constipation or any functional dyspepsia can lead pressure in left side Hope your concern solved Take care

input: my boyfriend has been c/o pain in his neck for about a week and then while working out he had a slight pain in his chest with a pulse of 134 and a blood pressure of 143/92 then after two days he has now woke up with slight kidney pain and voiding yellow urine with stringy blood in it what in the world could this be and what should be done?
output: HelloThanks for query. Your boyfriend seems to have pain in chest, loin and blood in urine (Hematuria). This is most likely to be due to presence of stone either in kidney or Ureter. He needs to consult qualified Urologist for evaluation and get following basic tests done to confirm the diagnosis .1) Routine urine test and urine culture 2) Ultrasound Scanning of the abdomen and pelvis. Ask him to take antibiotics and painkillers. Further treatment will be decided by concerned Urologist and will depend upon the results of these test and final diagnosis, Chat Doctor. 

input: hello sir , m a 24 yr old girl and m suffering from hair loss since last 2 years, i went to doc and he suggested me minoxidil topical solution usp 5% along with kevon stay on lotion . i use th solution twice daily 1ml every time , since one week i have been using but no results found , even m lossing more hairs ..... and i have irregular menstruation problem too. so plz help me out frm tis problem.
output: Hello dear, Since you are giving history of hair fall with irregular menses, you will need a hormonal workup to rule out any hormonal imbalance. If it is found then you will need treatment for the same. Minoxidil increases hair fall initially as it causes the non growing hair to fall out and new hair to grow from the same hair root. You will have to continue with it and should see new hair growth in 3-4 months time.

input: Hello, I would like to ask a question about a friend...he has been complaining abouta lump on his testicle for some time now. Earlier today a doctor he met did a quick examination at his job and told him he may have a cyst but thinks it is testicular cancer (no major exams were done, just a basic exam with his hands) my friends father had testicular cancer and now he is nervous. He also does not have any health insurance...what is his best option? the doctor who examinied him gave him his number and said he would cut him a deal doing a scan and further medical help... or should he just go to the hospital as he is in some pain. Thank you!
output: Testicular lesions require proper clinical evaluation. This is followed by battery of blood and radiological investigations which support the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of cancer can only be done by formal surgical procedure called Crevasses maneuver.

input: Hi, I injected my self with Clexane a return from holiday 12 days ago. I had a P.E 6 years ago.I am having to have oral surgery shortly, would the effects,(blood thinning) have worn off by now? So would it be OK to go ahead with the surgery at this time? An early response would be greatly appreciated.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. Dear friend, Clean has half-life of approximately 4.4 hours for a dose of 40 mg.  Clean activity may persist in the plasma for 24 hours. After 12 days its level in blood is negligible. You have to do one blood test PT INR. This blood test will be very helpful for further management and plan for oral surgery. I suggest you to take Clean in proper doctor guidance with regular PT INR test. Thanx for query.

input: Hi Dr,i have to take fertab 50 for the first time soon,before doing an insemination,i already have one kid ,6 years old.Is there possibilities of twins with fertab 50 from the first treatment?i am 33 years old,168cms and 59 kgs,first pregnancy was so easy but this time it is not.all medical exams were good,but no pregnancy yet so my doc suggested fertab 50 coz maybe the ovulation is weak and simple insemination coz the spermes may are not living too much in the matural way,thank you for your kind answer.
output: Hi, I think you can have twins, but it is rare. Track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. Will be done the next day. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months. Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: A few times a week and a couple times a day sometimes I get really dizzy and lately my vision has been blacking out along with the dizziness. I can catch myself and sit down before I fall and it only lasts from 7-13 seconds. It s happened since as far back as I can remember. I m only 16 and I never thought it was a problem but it s just becoming more common and wondering I it s something to worry about ?
output: Hi, Hi, Spells of dizziness with blackened vision can be caused by - -refractory error of eye.  -internal ear problem.  -cervical spondylitis affecting nerve supply ti internal ear.

input: I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 (Gleason s 10/10). I had a radical prostatectomy and have subsequently been treated at MD Anderson with intermittant lupron and casodex. My present condition is extremely good and has been so since surgery. On my most recent restaging and evaluation (Sept 2012) the term malignant neoplasm of prostate was included as an alert notice. I did not read this note until just recently. I am wondering if this indicates a change in my diagnosis, or has this terminology been relevant from day one?
output: Hi, Your prostate cancer risk stratification should be mentioned. You should mention your baseline PSA value before treatment and staging based on pathology report. As your Gleason score was 10 most probably your disease was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role (pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 NG/ml may indicate biochemical failure. Then your treatment can be changed. Another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 NG/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous. Take care.

input: I tripped and fell on the pavement on saturday landing on my knee. It has a pretty big scrape below my kneecap and the whole area is very sensitive and painful to the touch. I can feel it swell up, but it all seems to be inside my knee. I have been icing it, should I be concerned that it is still so painful?

input: I am a 60 yr old woman and recent diagnosis of enlarged mediastinal and ap window nodes. I have a 2cm cyst in right lobe of liver that is very painfull. 20 years ago I had a melanoma tumor on abdomen over liver area that was stage 2. It was big and required an 8 inch wide incision. The ct says the lesion of liver is a cyst, but I am concerned about the pain. I see a cardiac-thorasic surgeon in 2 weeks for the lymph node removal. Can the liver cyst be something more serious? I also had a melonoma on my forehead, cervical cancer and squamas cell carcinoma of vagina and vulva. With so much cancer history, I am very worried because of the pain and enlarged nodes.
output: Dear ! I have gone through your mail in details and could gather the facts. The liver cyst you've mentioned seems to be a simple cyst. It is very unlikely to be the cause of pain. Rarely a cystic liver secondary can look like this. Your treating surgeon can sort this out. Regards

input: Can pain in the lower right abdomen towards the back be my appendix even though I have no other symptoms? This pain in on the 3rd day. It was getting better until I picked up something heavy and it was like my insides ripped apart. What in the world?
output: Hi, I have read your complaints - pain in the right lower abdomen and back. The most common causes are - Appendicitis, Ureteric stone, ovarian cyst rupture in ladies.  I suggest you get an Ultrasonography of the abdomen, Blood counts and Urine examination. A thorough clinical examination by a Physician is of utmost importance.  Hence, I suggest you go to a Physician and later get ultrasonography(Advisable to not void/urinate for 2 hours prior to the scan as a full bladder helps the radiologist in doing the scan). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...My baby just had her first round of vaccinations about 48 hrs ago. She was sleepy yesterday but ate very well. Today she was fine in the am but hasnt really eaten in 6-7 hours and has excessive gas. She is crying more too. ???
output: Hello, This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is:1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

output: Hello AKT treatment is not expected to cause knee pain. Some medicines in antitubercular therapy may cause liver damage. So, it is important to monitor liver enzymes during AKT therapy.

Since October 2011 its been bothering me more and more with pain going round into my back and up between shoulder blades. Went to GP after awful night 10 days ago had vomited once and had slight diarohea.

Am on Nexium 40 mg for 10 days now and whilst the tenderness and discomfort near the ribs in the abdomen is not too bad the pain in my back is very persistent between the shoulders down low.

input: I have been diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer. No treatment has started yet, as they have found a mass in the left ovary area, even though my ovaries were removed at the age of 27. I am now 67. I will have MRI and & pelvic ultrasound next week. My oncologist said she has not seen this before. I am asking if it is possible to have cancer where there is no ovary? I have never had any problems or symptoms since my hysterectomy 40 years ago. Could it be linked to the breast cancer, both on the right side? Thank you. I am currently in a library with a dead cell phone battery trying to calm my fears, but, cannot contact my doctor until I get a working phone.
output: Yes it is still possible to have mass in adnexa after removing the ovaries. It can arise from the tubes or from the uterus. Sometimes and most commonly after removing both ovaries, tubes and uterus, cancer can arise from the peritoneum, that is cells lining the abdomen. Since you have breast cancer, spread from breast cancer also needs to be ruled out since that is also possible.

input: I am just recovering from a 3 week viral infection that caused throat pain, voice hoarseness, sinus congestion, and chest congestion with cough. Just when I think I am finally feeling better, I have developed sharp pain in my right parietal lobe region that only lasts a few seconds but is severe with a lingering soreness. The pain increases with movement. I don t palpate any tenderness over the region other than a small raised bump. I do have a cold blister in my right nares. I am concerned that the cold sore in my nares is related to the parietal lobe pain. Should I have this evaluated?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Possibility of connection between nose problem and parietal lobe pain is very less. But in rare cases, uncontrolled, severe sinusitis can cause meningeal infection and brain damage. But since you are improving in sinusitis, possibility of this is also very low. So no need to worry much. Avoid stress and tension. Take simple painkiller like ibuprofen. Your parietal lobe pain will mostly improve. But if you are still having pain than better to get done CT thorax and CT PNS (paranasal sinuses) to rule out internal brain pathology. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Hi,my husband had bad breath since childhood.after marriage,even i got it along with a slight change in voice.my dental hygiene was good.but started getting white spots on my tonsils which was diagnosed as tonsillar keratosis by an ENT specialist.Doctor suggested me surgery in worst case.But i dont want to go for a surgery n i remove those white keratosis with a sterile tweezer whenever it apppear. so no bad breath problem now. but my husbands breath smells very bad now a days. when i tried to see his tonsils,i couldnt see any keratosis or anything. Does he have any other problem? He never smoked or drinked alcohol.Which speciality should i take him for professional help? please suggest me. He is a bit reluctant to visit doc regarding this. Is there a chance that he had the same problem all these time what i am having after marriage?
output: reclothe reason for chronic bad breath could be either oral related or systemic (gastric problems) (kidney related) (liver problems)For oral related home carry doing these 4 things regularly twice daily morning and at night 1 proper brushing2 use interdental aids (proxy brush & dental floss) to clean in between teeth areas 3. Tongue cleaning is very important (use tongue cleaner)4. Start using mouth wash (for 3 weeks use chlorohexidine, and then you can use the milder one like list rein regularly)follow this strict regime of oral hygiene along with this u need professional cleaning every 6 months do visit dentist regularly and if it still persists than u might be having systemic problems.

output: Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. I analyze your report as, Volume 2ml (normal 2-5 ml) at borderline level normal. Viscocity normal pH 7.1 (normal 6-8)SPERM COUNT (query) normally it is 60-120 millions total. In your semen it is 20 million / ml and your semen is 2 ml, so in aggregate it is 40 millions means below normal. Normally if semen is taken after 3-4 days abstinence than its volume increases, so in that case it may be 3 ml than count will be normal. Motility is usually 90-100 % but in your semen it is 70% so they (sperms) are less motile than normal. Immobile 10 % and this is also normal (normal 10% immobile)20% are straight, and they are dead.  Rest of analysis is non-specific so no discussion. In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion and treatment.

input: Hi around 6 weeks ago I went and had a mammogram for a lump around an inch long the results came back that it was glandular tissue, but I ve noticed the past few days that it has either moved across my breast or has grown and I ve also found a small lump under my nipple and what looks like red veins on the surface of my breast where the glandular has either grown or moved what should I do.
output: Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be an inflammatory reaction or any of those breast lesions. It could be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. Malignancy must also be ruled-out. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics such as breast ultrasound and mammography may be recommended. Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

input: Several weeks ago, I accidentally hit my knee coming out of a bad round-off backtuck. I hit it on the floor and now there is a burning, tearing sensation on the medial side of my patella. It progressively felt better and there was only a little pain when I would put pressure on my knee and when the quad muscles were being stretched. Today, hit my knee again on a bad roundoff backhandspring and now the pain is back in the same area; there is slight swelling. My knee was flexed both times when it was hit, but there was no twisting.

Use support while walking. Use knee cap. Do regular physical therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: I received routine blood work back showing an AST of 53 and an ALT of 74. I am hypothyroid, taking 1.0 of Synthroid per day. My TSChatDoctore back 6.3. What would cause the elevated AST and ALT? How likely is it that I have hepatitis or cancer? Can the elevated TSH affect the AST and ALT? I am a non-drinker and take no medications except Synthroid (not even Tylenol). I do take calcium cabonate and vitamin D (several hours after the Synthroid dose. I also use Metameucil wafers twice a day (again several hours away from medication). I am a 57 year old, white female. Other tests came back normal. I had a colonoscopy about 4 years ago, and was diagnosed with IBS.
output: AST and ALT are nonspecific tests, which means they could be elevated for many reasons. That includes both hepatitis or cancer. I don't believe the elevations are related to the high TSH. You are in an age group where chronic hepatitis C is commonly diagnosed. Hepatitis C can cause such elevations without a lot of symptoms. If you were my patient, that is one of the first things I would check. At the same time, you could also be checked for other types of hepatitis. Other problems with your liver or problems with your gallbladder might also cause the elevations.  Hope this answers your query. If you have more questions, I would be happy to answer them.

Is it normal for my BC to pretty much rid me of my period like this?
output: The longer that you're on birth control pills the more likely it is that you will cease to have a period. It does not mean that the birth control pill is not effective. On the contrary it is working very well. The lining of the womb has become so thin that there is nothing to shed. In other words the progestin has won out over the estrogen. Many women actually like this as a side effect of taking oral contraceptives. You will have to take a stronger estrogen containing pill to avoid the side effect but I don't think there's any medical reason that you need to.

input: I am 28 yrs old my semen counting is 64% I want a child so what can I do??
output: Hello Bacchus;welcome to Chat Doctor If the motility of your semen is 64% then you are fine and if the normal form of sperms are more than 60% then you will become a father. So only semen count is not important you should write the detailed report to understand it better and guide you. I guess all the other reports of you as well as your wife are normal. The main criteria for having a baby are:--regular periods -proper ovulation-patent fallopian tubes -normal semen analysis If these things are normal you will have a baby To increase the chances you should have sex alternate day from 10th day of start of menses till 21 day as it is more fertile period.

output: You can give to child remain during 2weeks-1 month, but she can not Chat Doctor.  This is just symptomatic therapy. If you were give for a long time a fat -soluble vitamins, like as A, D, E, K would not absorb properly. It also gives anal irritation. You should give to her laxative food like as Dali, boiled rubber beetroots with 1 teaspoon of olive or sunflower oil. You can also give tomato soup with beetroots. Give to your baby -girl fresh juice 100ml from carrots, beetroots, orange, apple or rubber apple. Pumpkin soup or sheer from pumpkin is very helpful. ADU, salad from cucumber and tomato and onions with sunflower or olive oil. Corn oatmeal. You can give green tea with ginger and turmeric powder1/2 teaspoon for 2 glasses. She should eat more liquid.

output: You might have broken your ribs at the time of injury. The swollen lumps might be of uniting fracture.12 weeks is enough time for fracture to get united. But as you are still having pain and even your age is 82 the fracture might not have united and that's why you are having pain. Ct scan advised by your doctor is to check the union status of the fracture and also to rule out any other pathology.

Associated with aura before seizure and then little depression after seizure. Keeping him calm, relaxed, Loosening his tight Chat Doctor.  Cold water won't help him much.

input: hi, recently i had a blood vomit . in consultation with a doctor i under went a abdominal ultra sonoraphy. the following are the results. -fatty liver -enlarged spleen : 125 mm i have been prescribed the following medicines. silimarin 140mg pantodec dsr beplex forte digecaine syrup after following the prescription for a day, i now have mild fever and stomach ache with irregular bowel movement . can you please suggest a way out.
output: Hi, Vomiting blood is not normal. It could be due to ulcer disease or due to varices secondary to liver disease. Since the ultrasound scan shows enlarged spleen, bleeding due to varices is more likely. An upper GI endoscopy should be done to confirm the source of bleeding. If it is varietal bleeding, it can be controlled endoscopically. You may have to be on long term medications. If it is due to ulcer disease, then you have to be tested for H.pylori infection and treat it if found to be positive. I hope that answers your question. Regards.

input: Im a 69-year-old female with slightly elevated BP controlled with meds but otherwise in good health.  Recently Ive been experiencing very hard single hearbeats (sometimes almost painful) throughout the day.  No other symptoms, but theyre making me nervous.
output: Palpitation is what you are describing. The sensation of single beats is reassuring. In the office, I usually recommend nothing but reassurance. If symptoms don't resolve on their own, a long term monitor to try and catch the abnormal rhythm and tie it to the symptoms that you feel is useful. Once you know what it is and that it doesn't matter, that alone makes it bearable.

input: Ok doc, so i ejaculated when me and my girlfriend were messing around but this ejaculation was not in the vagina. I then went pee, awhile later we were messing around again and i had pre cum. I stuck it in about twice. Did my pee kill the sperm from a previous ejaculation and did my precum contain sperm from the previous ejaculation or was it flushed out?
output: Hi, Do not worry. Your pre-cum did not contain sperms, because urination would have flushed out your semen. Take precautions.like condone during next meeting with your girlfriend. Hope this helps. Regards. Chat Doctor.

Please let me know the remedies ? Is it curable or not ? and how serious is this in future ? What are the medications that I should take?

output: Hi I have gone through your description and your MRI report. In my opinion, as you are suffering from PIED C4-5, C5-6 (L) sided, all your symptoms are explained except leg symptoms. In my practice I would advise painkillers muscle relaxants, physiotherapy and Isometric Neck Exercises for 10-15 days following which I will go only for Exercises and postural adjustments as long term solution.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here.my daughter regularly uses asthalin respules bcoz of cold and cough and 2 years before heart surgery was done so i wanna know that there is any side effect of regularly using respules
output: Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Common side effects of Stalin (Albuterol) are increased heart rate, sometimes irregular heart rate, feeling of heart beats (palpitation), tremors especially in hands, "shaky feeling" in the body, reduced blood potassium levels (leading to fatigue and muscle cramps), irritation or Chat Doctor. As she has had a heart surgery, personally I would prefer levosalbutamol over albuterol for her. Levosalbutamol has almost similar actions as albuterol (Stalin) but less heart-related side effects such as rapid/irregular heart beats. Please discuss this matter with her treating doctor. Hope above answer will be helpful to your daughter. Wish her the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

input: hi my 17yr old son has a lump that is very hot on his left side and is pale and feeling weak with constant  pain and has also had trouble breathing and has had to use his ventolin inhaler a few times in the past 2 days (hes an asthmatic) and  approx 6 wks ago he was taken to emergency by ambulance and diagnosed with appendicitis but discharged himself when the pain reduced do u think it is the same condtion/?
output: Hi. Thank you for your query. Read and understood you sons problems. Appendicitis is usually on the right side of the abdomen not on the left. The hot thing on the left side can be a subcutaneous abscess developed secondary to the appendicular lump or abscess. Pale can be due to septicemia. As he is known asthmatic, you have to take more care and may be give him additional medicines and inhalers to get a proper control over the asthma. The appendicular lump is usually treated conservatively for 6 weeks so that it has to be operated when this becomes resolved. Remember that getting operated on the given date is very important.

output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Yellow fluid behind ear is something not normally seen in a one MTV old especially to an extent you mentioned. It's extremely difficult to comment on without having a look. However, the things that I can think of is pus secondary to some infection behind ear. I would suggest you consult a pediatrician for a proper opinion. Hope your child gets well soon. Take care.

input: I have been taking Gleevec 400 mg daily for control of GIST . My last ct scan showed no evidence of disease. In the last few weeks my fluid load has become more problematic. I have puffy edema everywhere I had a 10 pound weight gain in 3 days and was directed by my primary doctor to double my 40 mg Lasix to 80 mg whenever this occurs. My tissues are like sponges that depress and stay that way. I am concerned about the effects this much fluid may have on my heart.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor! I appreciate your concern for the generalized puffy edema. Accumulation of fluid due to salt and water retention is an important adverse effect of Sleeve chemotherapeutic Chat Doctor.  This side effect is commonly seen during the long treatment with Sleeve, it may be associated with high BP and sometimes the fluid gets collected in the lungs causing difficulty in breathing, etc. Now since the scan is not showing the evidence of the GIST you may please consult your doctor whether to continue with Sleeve for how many weeks or months. Lasix definitely helps in clearing the edema fluid, but it also has some side effects on its long run. Take care of your health.

input: My wife is suffering from lower abdomen with back pain last 4 months. She has been seizure 18 months ago. I have consulted his Gynecological doctor. He advise for USG and some Blood test. The result of USG and blood test is ok. After seeing the report he advise Gynazole 200 (at night 1 cap), i-flag( daily 1 cap), Normaton. But there is no improvement and again consult him after 2 months and he advise Gynazole 200(at night) and Tryptomer 25(at noon and at night) and normatone(2 tea spoon at noon and at night). Is these medicine right for my wife? what is the cause of pain ?
output: HI. Thanks for your query. Read the history and understood your wives problem. The reason of lower abdominal pain with back pain for 4 months can be the following :Pelvic inflammatory disease - Endometriosis. Diseases of the ovaries and / tubesEnteritisColitisMyometritis. As the Caesarion section was 18 months ago, this may not be related to the present problems. The medicines given by Her Gynecologists are based on the reports, which you say OK. Gynecologist must have done an internal examination and thought of PID or Endometriosis as a major cause hence gave the medicines. Also, must have thought about anxiety or stress hence added few more medicines like trypromer and so. I think these are good medicines but if they are not helping, we have to think about other causes. In such a case I would advise the following:CT scan of the abdomenDiagnostic Laparoscopy has a major role to play and this is a common practice now. It allows the direct visualization of the whole abdomen, its contests, particularly, uterus, tubes and ovaries in this case. Hence, the diagnosis m biopsy and treatment can be undertaken in many patient. Please discuss this with your Gynecologist or take a second opinion of a General Surgeon practicing Laparoscopic surgeries, Or a Castro Surgeon.

input: What are symptoms for kidney stones/colic?  My husband is having pain + severe cramps and in his urine is blood.  It lasts now for 4 hours. I thought it is urinary infection but I dont know what symptoms for kidney problems are? We are camping and I dont know if I should take him to the hospital?my e-mail address:   YYYY@YYYY
output: Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor Stones can occur in any aspect of the urinary tract-the urethra, bladder, ureter and kidney. In general, they are associated with severe pain, which is usually cramping or intermittent in nature, in some cases the pain may radiate from the loin (the lower back) to the groin. Urinary infections would be associated with burning on urination, frequency, possible change in the color and odor of the urine, abdominal pain. If the pain is severe, it would be best to take him to be assessed. An ultrasound may be suggested. If it is a stone, the treatment may depend on the size and the presence of any complications. Small stones may pass on their own. I hope this helps

input: I am writing concerning my 6 year old daughter. She has battled an infection around the vaginal area and what looks like ulcers. She has been checked for every type of STD and bacterial infection and has seen 3 Doctors and 1 Dermatologist. Their diagnosis was Erysipelas and the treatment was a strong antibiotic. Today, she was seen by a 4th Pediatrician and he tested her for bacteria that may be the cause of a fissure. He also said she has a yeast infection around the vaginal and anal area. He prescribed Diflucan 100 MG (2 tablets). She will see him again next week when the test results come back. Is this common for a 6 year old and should I start her on a stool softener in the mean time?
output: Hi, It seems that she might be having yeast infection with super added bacterial infection producing all these symptoms. Continue with all these medicines till full course. Important is to keep her local hygiene clean, Chat Doctor. After proper cleaning apply antibiotic or triple action cream. Wear cotton short and avoid more perspiration on local part. Give her proper instruction and training about keeping personal hygiene clean and healthy. Rule out worm infestation which again cause infection and irritation. Ok and take care.

output: Hi, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Benign tumors of the liver are uncommon in general population but are fairly common in patients who take any form of pills with a high estrogen content (oral contraceptive pills, hormonal therapy, anabolic steroids, etc.). Hepatic Adenoid is one such tumor which occurs very often in these set of patients. Going by your history, I would strongly suspect that you have developed an Adenoid in your liver. Although these things remain asymptomatic for a long time, they can cause pain due to increase in size. A more Chat Doctor.  In addition to this, there is also a risk of the tumor becoming cancerous. Follicular nodular hyperplasia of the liver is another possibility, but the current imaging techniques should be able to differentiate the two. The first thing to do after a Hepatic adenoid is diagnosed, is to stop all forms of hormonal therapy. This usually causes a

output: Hi, I think this is psychological problems. You have increased awareness of your own heart beat rather than loud heart. You need to convince yourself that things are fine and try to ignore the problem. Listening to our heart is not indicative of any heart illness. So probably you should learn to ignore it.

output: Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I would like to know your age, sex, any other diseases you have, any other medications you are taking, any other allergic disorders you have, etc. Furthermore, I would also like to know detailed description of your urticaria symptoms. However, from your history, I would like to suggest you as follows:1. Most important thing - allergy testing is not 100% to identify the cause, especially in cases of long-term urticaria like yours. So although you have been tested positive for a few food substances, personally I would suggest you to observe your food and correlate with urticaria. If urticaria does not appear within 2-3 hours of taking a food item, even if it is tested positive, you may start eating it gradually. You may not be really allergic to that particular food item.2. I would like to know whether you take any other medicines regularly. Particularly analgesics like ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc. can cause urticaria. In that case, please contact your physician who will suggest you alternative Chat Doctor. 3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you a short course of antiparasitic treatment with nitazoxanide or albendazole. Many times, intestinal parasites also can cause chronic urticaria.4. Personally I would suggest you investigations like complete blood count, ESR, CRP, Thyroid function tests, Urine and stool routine & microscopic examination. These may give clue to cause of your urticaria symptoms.5. For treatment, till the cause is found, I would suggest you to continue taking an antihistamine like HY

output: Hello, Thanks for your query. The problem you are experiencing is called Cortisone flare, which is a brief increase of pain for 1 to 3 days. It occurs when the cortisone crystallizes after injection. Rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can provide relief.

I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

output: Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. You are likely having sprain ankle.

input: I fell down the steps about a month ago. I noticed pain off and on but never got it checked. Here lately, the pain is back but more frequent. Today there is now a burning sensation and pain running from what feels like my neck to wrist. I also feel pain when trying to lay on my side. What could possibly be wrong?
output: Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have burning sensation and pain in the neck and wrist. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like radiculopathy, cervical spondylosis, herniated disk, mononeuropathy, peripheral neuropathy , neuralgia, multiple sclerosis or hyperparathyroidism. I would suggest you to apply warm compresses to neck and wrist, take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain and take proper rest. If condition doesn't get better than consult orthopedic surgeon for proper examination. Doctor may order CT scan, MRI along with nerve conduction. Doctor may order anti-inflammatory along with muscle relaxant and nerve supplement. Doctor may recommend surgery in severe damage. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,

input: Hi doctor,My FNAC report of Left superaclavicular lymph node done, findings areSmears are moderately cellular & show multiple well formed epithelioid cell granulomes,multinucleate giant cells & scattered histiocytes against a reactive background. No evidence of casesous necrosis seen. ZN stain for AFB is negative.Impression: Granulomatous lymphadenitis1.Is this a cancer or TB2. Is this a normal diease ,can be cured with normal medicines.3. anything to worry about.
output: Dear Sir/ Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. From your report it looks like you are suffering from tuberculosis. Sometimes gaseous necrosis can be missing (characteristic of TB) and ZN staining can also be negative. You can get a PCR done for TB and this would give us more information. The report is certainly not suggestive of cancer. It is turns out to be TB, it can be treated with medicines and would not require surgery. Hoping for the best.

Now in the past year I am having chin twitches and it is very annoying and embarrassing.  what can I do and could something else be wrong?
output: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be related to a pinched nerve (nerve compression), probably from the adherence during surgery in this region. I recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical exam. A nerve conduction study is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Surgery may be needed. In the meantime, I recommend taking clonazepam for symptomatic relief. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,

You first go for routine blood, urine and stool examination, then consult physician or dermatologist for further co relation with clinical symptoms.

input: Hi, my gf and i were fooling around and i ejeculated, there was some sperm on my hand, around 5 minutes after that we started fooling around again and without thinking i i introduced my hand in her vagina, I think she was in a really fertile moment since it happened 13 days after her menstruation, how possible is it that she may be pregnant?
output: HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. Generally, fingering cannot result in a pregnancy. Also, pre ejaculatory fluid can lead to pregnancy at times, however you have not mentioned if any penetrative vaginal sex occurred. Sperm cannot survive outside in the hostile environment for 5 minutes, according to me, the chances of a pregnancy resulting from the encounter described are next to nil. If there was no vaginal penetration, then pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you are very concerned, you can still ask her to take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) as a precautionary measure. When taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex, it is more than 80 % effective in guarding against a pregnancy. The expected period can be advanced or postponed for almost a week, after taking the Echo there is no way to predict the next date of her period. To be on the safer side, if you think there was some chance of a pregnancy please take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the episode occurred. All the betake care.

input: My father is 74. He has been having episodes where he doesnt know what day it is or if he has eaten or showered that day. He was recently diagnosed with Parkinson s disease with a chance of dementia. They did an MRI on Monday. It says Minimal Involutional Changes Appear Chronic. He is also very moody and saying hateful and hurtful things. He has always been difficult to deal with but he is getting really bad. My first thought was Alzheimer s. Any suggestions?
output: Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that his symptoms seem to be related to depression. From the other hand cognitive changes are common complications during Parkinson disease. They are related to the degradation of the brain cells, related to the disease itself. Besides, mood changes can also be related to Parkinson therapy. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with his neurologist and performing some cognitive tests in order to determine properly his cognitive problems. A psychiatric evaluation is also necessary to exclude possible depression, which can interfere with his memory and attention. There are different treatment options which can help improve his mood changes and his memory. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Kind regards, 

input: Hey my daughter is seven and has been running a fever for2 days. I have been rotating tylenol and motrin every 4 to 6 hours but her temps are really high.105.8 was her last temp taking on her forehead and 107.0 under her arm. I use a digital temporal thermometer would that be accurate and should I take her to the ER?
output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health. Regards -

output: Here you might have problems with kidney(kidney stone) or hemorrhoid since you yourself are comfortable for passing urine and little problem while passing stools I suggest do not diagnosed on your own and take specialist opinion. If there is no problem as per doctor then you can use hot pack at your painful area to have relaxing effect on soft tissues. Here some more details are missing from your end1. Since when you have this problem?2. How many times a day you need to go for bowel and bladder movement.? That is for urinate or for passing stool.3. Do you have any burning sensation while passing urine?4. Does your pain go down after passing urine or passing stool? Based on this as well with physical examination only a doctor can evaluate your problem So I suggest get it evaluated properly and go for treatment as per that. Take care.

input: Hi, I am 35 year old woman and recently gone through menstural blood pcr test and mycobacterial have been detected. My doctor said, I will not get pregnant because of this situation and suggested some medication for 3 months. and also said if I wont conceive in these 3 months, she needs to do some tube test. I am really scared that I will never get pregnant. I desperately want a baby. Can you share your thoughts on the above? Thanks
output: Hello premenstrual blood PCR positive for mycobacterium suggests endometrial tuberculosis. In the woman, it causes tuberculous enteritis (infection of the uterus) and salpingitis (infection of the tubes). This infection can often be silent, and may not cause any symptoms or signs. Once the histologic diagnosis of TB endometriosis has been made(like in your case), then treatment with antitubercular medicine must be started to prevent further progression of the disease. However, usually with TB endometriosis, infection of the fallopian tubes also occurs, and the damage caused to the tubes (TB salpingitis) is irreversible. Infection of tubes might result in irreversible tubal infertility, and the only treatment option available then to conceive would be IVF. In the past some doctors would try to do surgery to repair the tubes, but this is futile surgery, because the tubes never work properly once they have been infected. Tubes which have been severely damaged may form a HY Chat Doctor. Although antitubercular chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, surgery may be indicated where medical therapy has failed to resolve symptoms and in presence of a persistent pelvic mass. So I suggest for now you continue with your antitubercular

My Doctor put me on an anti-depressant and that helped a little but not for long. Is there a test that I should be looking at doing?
output: Hello, Your symptoms could be related to repeated head trauma. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing some cognitive tests and a brain MRI. Other tests to consider would be: complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, vitamin D and vitamin E plasma levels, and vitamin B12 plasma levels. You should discuss with your doctor on these tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: My mom is 59 and had a hysterectomy after determining that she had cancerous cells. She had begun a liquid diet and partly solid diet and was doing well (all while in patient). She started solid food in the morning and appeared to tolerate it well. that afternoon she was given potassium supplements and since then she s vomited, unable to tolerate any food, has limited intestinal sounds and we ve been told that her intestine is not awake. What can our next step be to help her recuperate?
output: Hi, It is not clear from your question what sort of cancer she is suffering from. Hysterectomy may be done for both uterine cancer and cervix cancer (total hysterectomy with bilateral ovary and tube removal). The problem you have mentioned probably is a post-operative complication. During operation gut handling may be the cause. As you have not mentioned on what post-operative day the problem started detail explanation is a bit difficult but regular electrolyte monitoring preferably at 24 hr interval and conservative management is the best option. It will be definitely corrected. After the surgical management is over you may need adjuvant treatment depending on disease pathology so keep in touch with your gynecologist and oncologist.  Take care.

While she usually has a cough/ runny nose when these vomiting episodes occur, she isn t coughing when she starts throwing up. She never throws up more than once.
output: Hi.... if your child height and weight or normal then you need not worry about this vomiting episodes. If vomiting has been pathological or really disturbing her general constitution then her weight will be the first thing to go down when compared to peers. But if her weight is low, then she will require evaluation. Regards -

input: I had a abnormal pap about a month ago ,I have pain in lower back and lower stomach and I also have HA MRS and Barnet esophagus my chest and upper back feels like some one standing on it all the time. Saw a OB GYN he just told me it s I was going though the change of life . Have a partial hysterectomy about 20 years ago in 2011 had to have ovaries removed due to them being infected . I am 51 and having a lot of pain in my vaginal area and lower stomach and back. Upper chest and left breast and my throat feels as if it s on fire all the time, can t talk very well do to the esophagus trouble. Thank you for answering my questions if you can
output: Hi. Thanks for your query. I have read and understood your concerns:You have a Barrels esophagus, abnormal Pap smear, pain in lower back and stomach; HA MRS and feels that someone is standing on your chest and back, consulted a Gynecologist, and He said that you are going through your stage of change of life at the age of 51. You have already undergone partial hysterectomy along with removal of both the ovaries in 2011 that is 4 years back and the changes night have occurred immediately after the surgery as the ovaries have already been removed. Hence, can not be correlated to the hormonal changes. I would advise you the following:- Get clinical evaluation and physical examination done by a General Surgeon and get investigated accordingly. - CT scan of the abdomen can tell if there is a chance of cancer of the cervix as you had undergone partial hysterectomy.- Pain in the vaginal area can be due to low estrogen you have.- Pain in the chest and breast on fire feeling can be due to Barrett's esophagus, needs regular follow-up with upper GI Endoscopy to see that it is not progressed to become a cancer or so. If required you may have to go for CT scan of the chest too. I hope this answer helps you to get a proper diagnosis as you have multiple problems and that they may not be related.

input: Hi I just noticed that the bottom of my tongue has these big dark purple veins under it. I have had a couple of gum abscesses. 1 the tooth broke off and the abscess only comes once in a while. The second the abcess has been draining continually past couple of yrs and the tooth recently started to break.

input: Mr. Jackson, age 65, comes to the doctor s office complaining of a sharp pain in the right side of his chest. He says his chest hurts when he breathes deeply or coughs. This is a problem, he says, because he has been coughing a lot, has difficulty drawing breath, and feels a tightness in the center of his chest. What condition or conditions might the doctor suspect? What methods of diagnosis would the doctor use, and what specific signs would the doctor look for to pinpoint the cause?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. According to his symptoms, possibility of bronchitis or lung infection is more likely. He is having pleuritic pain (pain on deep breathing). Pleuritic pain is characteristically seen in pneumonia and bronchitis. So doctor will auscultate his lungs. If it sounds like wheezing then bronchitis is more likely and hence PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) is needed. If it sounds like crests then pneumonia is more likely and hence chest x-ray is needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your patient. Thanks.

A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isnt constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. Its in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words cant describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where im getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. Im just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but theres no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful. If i honestly thought it was my heart and i had no trouble at all with back or neck pain, id be at the hospital right now. I just honestly dont feel its my heart and i know how ridiculous my back feels right now with the pain im in. Im only 35, so i dont think its a heart attack or stroke or anything and i have no tingling or numbness or anything in my arms/hands. Just want to know if severe back pain and spine out of place can transfer pain to your front and affect other things to give you the neck pain and chest tightness ive just described. Thank you for you help.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for asking the query. In my opinion this is not heart attack or stroke. The pain at the back and in the spine does not come to the front just below the collar bone. The pain you are having in front and at the back are two separate pains. If I was your treating physician I will do the following:1. Take detailed assessment of your mood and anxiety. Sometimes such pains are associated with depression and anxiety disorder. Treating depression/anxiety improves the outcome of pain as well. 2. Get your x-ray spine done. 3. Examine the throat and chest for any abnormality.4. Get an ECG done.5. Consider starting antianxiety and pain modulating medicines. I hope this helps you.2.

input: i have a small burning spot on my back lung or rib at present i have brochortis and allergies taken medicine for both when i breahe very that is when the burning spot starts doent seem larger than a dime to quaeter size it just started this evening did not know if it heart related or my condition to the brochortis abd allergies
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis and allergy related symptom is more rather than heart related. Bronchitis and allergies when uncontrolled can cause worsening inflammation in lungs. And this can cause burning type of sensation. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of inflammation. On the basis of PFT values, treatment is advised. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are treatment of choice. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Hi, i am pregnant for the second time. Unfortunately i miscarried around 20 weeks in June. I should be about 8 weeks pregnant on November 10 but i have had light bleeding. The first occurance was two days ago it was just a light flow that ended basically as soon as it started. I rested until today when i had a lot of walking i needed to do and then i bleed again. My worry is compounded by the fact that i have had a lot of acid problems and constipation so i am not sure if my stomache pain has other more sinister causes. I am only due to see my OB in a week. Thank you in advance for your answer.
output: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there are various causes for bleeding or spotting in pregnancy like hormonal abnormalities like thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, abnormal pregnancy,low-lying placenta, bleeding from cervix etc. I suggest you to rule out the above causes by getting done physical examination, thyroid profile to rule out thyroid abnormalities, ultrasound to know the pregnancy status. Nothing to worry. Once the cause is treated it will subside. Avoid physical strain and intercourse. Take strict bed rest. But if the bleeding has not stopped consult doctor. Hope this helps. Best regards...

input: My mum(89) has just had a CT scan and MRI scan on her liver.An physical examination found her liver was enlarged --she has sometimes got an  enlarged abdomen that is occasionally hard to touch I presume they are checking for liver cancer --any other possibilities Thanks Ian
output: Hi thanks for asking question. Enlarge liver could be by infection, cancer or hemolytic anemia... Your doctor has done your physical examination. So he might have suspected cancer and let's see report of CT scan... Another possibility if cancer not present could be hepatitis ...If you need viral marker may be needed. It could be by chronic hemolysis also ex.thalassemia, autoimmune hemolysis, Chat Doctor. For hemolysis primary work up us with peripheral smear examination and relic count... If still exact cause not clear USG guided biopsy done for final approach... Hope your concern solved.... Take care.

input: Hi, I am 22 years old and I have been suffering with abdominal pain for months now, I have been back and forth to the Doctors but don t seem to be getting any answers, the pain was in the upper middle abdomen but now it seems to be under my left rib and in my back, I feel sick almost every day and sometimes the pain is so bad I struggle to find a position to relieve it. I have an 18 month old Daughter and this pain is making life hard work. I had a natural vaginal birth however I had to be put under anesthetic to have my placenta removed. I am very good with pain but this is so aggravating..I have had an abdominal ultra sound and it came back normal so please please help me or give me some idea what this could be. Amy.
output: Hi Amy, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that your pain in abdomen is due to increased acidity in the stomach. You should follow some precautions like :-1. Avoid spicy and oily foods.2. Donor miss a meal.3. Avoid emotional/mental stress.4. Avoid doing self-medication especially with painkillers and steroids.5.  Chat Doctor.  You can take antacid like Omeprazole 20 mg daily along with Risperidone 10 mg for relief from your symptoms. Antacid in gel or liquid form is also beneficial as it forms a protective layer over the damaged mucosa of the stomach. You can get yourself investigated for :-1. H. pylori infection.2. Endoscopy. If the problem persists, get your examined and investigated by Gastroenterologist. I hope this is useful to you. Thanks.

Been to chiropractor 4 times and says its my lower lumbar but treatments haven t helped. not sure what more I can do. Tylenol, ibuprofen/ naproxen is not helping. thinking it may be more seiours. I know what sciatica pain is and its not that. I don t have credit card with me, didn t know I had to pay
output: Thank you for sharing your complaint, dear friend your low back pain seems muscular pain. You should consult orthopedic/neurophysician nearer to you when you are in your city. Presently if you have severe pain then take muscle relaxant medicine like combination of diclofenac+paracetamol+chlorzoxazon. Exercise and physiotherapy will help you a lot. If possible consult physiotherapist nearer to you.-exercise for low back pain-raise your one lower extremity straight from hip joint without bending from knee after sleeping on back and then put down slowly. Same exercise for another lower extremity. And then for both leg simultaneously. Sleep on abdomen and raise your head and chest backward. Increase this exercise every day. Hope this answer will be helpful to you. For more queries please don't hesitate to ask. Get well soon dear friend

output: Hi, first there is no need to panic. Platelet count above 20000 will cause no harm to the child. Secondly adequate liquid diet is more important in dengue fever.

input: My husband was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Lukemea) that has mutaion or moleclar change in a gene called Flt 3.  He is under going treatment and completed the fourth Chemo cycle.  Also he is on a study drug calledI Midosaturin .  I recently  read that  Imitinef Mercilet is a cure for Blood Cancer and it is available at Adayar Cancer Institute, Chennai, India.  Is it correct?  The name of the medicine is :Imitinef Mercilet
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Since your husband is diagnosed with AML which is a type of blood cancer, chemotherapy is one of the best solutions for him. Midostaurin is a promising medicine and is under multiple research and treatment trials. If your husband is getting this medicine then let him continue taking it under the recommendation of his doctor. It is considered effective for a type of cancer called systemic mastocytosis. The promotion of limiting merciless in some sections of media is misrepresented. Just like midostaurin, limiting merciless is the name of another medicine which was in trials some time back. This medicine was not totally curative for all blood cancers but under research for certain blood cancer types. Unfortunately due to public ignorance, this was made in to a news report and mail and circulated among unintended sections of society. It is important not to get misled by such details. Please do not worry.

Her serem creatinine level is 9.9mg/dl for now and doctors here say that kidney transplant operation has to be done as soon as possible. But getting the source for kidney is never easy.

input: In the last six months I ve had two fusion surgeries done. One at my C3-C4 and one at my L5-S1. I came out of the neck fusion fine, textbook recovery and doing well. However, with my back surgery I developed a really bad reaction to the surgical glue they used to glue the steri-strips (sp?) to hold my incision together. After a medrol dose pack I was fine, and felt very well at about 2-3 weeks post op. Then suddenly at about 4 weeks I developed a really bad itching with swelling in my hands and feet as well as huge hives, small welts and patches of rash all over my arms, neck, chest, tops of my feet, on my face and in my ears. At one point I ended up with a swelling and burning feeling on the left side of my tongue and left tonsil. My hands and feet would end up being painful in all the joints at the worst flare ups . I ended up going to the ER three times for various problems with this reaction and was told to take benadryl. After followup with my primary care he put me on hydroxyzine and another medrol dose pack. After finishing the dose pack I did really well for about 3-4 days and even got to where I didn t have to take anything for itching/hives. But then the rashes, itching and hives have slowly come back and gotten worse, I m now on another medrol dose pak and taking the hydroxyzine every 4-6 hours. Originally my surgeon s PA thought it was a reaction to the Norco and Robaxin I was on post surgery so I ve been off of that for about 3 weeks or so. My primary care doctor believes this is a an over reaction my body is having due to the trauma of having two major surgeries within a 6 month time period. My questions are: Is this possible? And if so, why does it happen and how long can it last? When should I be worried that something else is going on with my body? I don t have a history of allergies except a reaction to penicillin when I was about 8 years old. I ve never even had seasonal allergy issues so I m really at a loss as to what I can do.
output: Hello, Your symptoms seem to be related to an allergic reaction. I suggest doing the allergic tests for further evaluation.  Meanwhile, I suggest using Loratadine to prevent the symptoms.  I also suggest using HY Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: I have occasional perception of weakness in my limbs since the last few years (particularly in the left upper & lower limbs), with a slightly increased frequency over the past few months. I have no problem with gripping or lifting an object etc. as such, just that the left hand feel a little more tired when I lift it as compared to the right. I also get tingling and burning sensation in my palms and feet sometimes and also in certain parts of the body, which are non specific and transient. Of late, I am also experiencing occasional gentle transient pain or a sudden pulse of pain in my limbs (probably along the nerves)  , neck and sometimes inside the head too, though, this are non-location specific (meaning, the pain is not in the same spot all the time. eg. sometimes its the right side of the head, sometimes left, sometimes around the cheek bone etc. I am non-diabetic with normal BP and 40 years of age. I have been detected with dyslipidemia some 6-7 years back and since then I am on Atorvastatin 10 mg ( was briefly in 5 mg dose too in between) and have my lipid profile under control. I have also been prescribed with aspirin 75 mg, since the last 4 months. I have consulted neurologist for my problem and my problem, mentioned here, has been attributed to stress / anxiety. Is the diagnosis correct? For the problem, I have been prescribed Tryptomer 10 mg, which I am yet to start, as I read somewhere it is an anit-depressant, has a sedative effect and can be addictive. Hence, I want to avoid it. Is it Ok, if I try and control it with diet, meditation and relaxation excercises? Or, I need to take the medicine to cure myself. Please note that the problem I face is not very acute, but nonetheless when it occurs it makes me nervous about my well being and fate. May kindly advise.
output: Hi. My opinion is that you might be having a hemiparesis- i.e. weakness on one side of the body. This is usually a sign of an area in your brain that is not getting enough blood supply. With a history of dyslipidemia there is a possibility of a mild stroke or transient ischemic attacks. My advice is to have a brain scan to verify if there is no central lesion in the brain. Hope that helps.

input: Hi, I am trying to get pregnant for the last 7 months.my age is 36 years old. I have a 5 year old daughter. In October 2014, my TSH was 12. After taking levoflox(50mgm daily) my TSH is a bit suppressed -0.2My endo has told me to change dosage and take 50mgm every alternate day. All other tests ( T3and T4) are normal Could the fluctuating thyroid affects my conception.I have consulted a fertility specialist and all fertility test were normal(Tubal patency, pelvic scan , ovary function,Lsh level)But my partners Siemens analyses show total motility  at 27% and progressive motility at 4%.what can he do to increase motility and could this be causing problems with conceiving? Are there any other test you would recommend to check fertility-thanks
output: Hi thyroid levels do affect pregnancy chances. Get a repeat TSH done and prolactin levels too. Your husband can take some antioxidant prescribed by a doctor. Do a semen culture for your husband as sometimes infections may lead to decreased motility. You can try for ovulation induction with GUI. It will look be a good option for you considering your husband semen analysis.

He s slowly started reducing power of drugs with powers mentioned above. But, it seems I ve developed dependency on these medicines. And, I want to stand on my own with my thought controlling me rather than medicines. In this blog, I read in answer to one patient, reference to Meditation, Self Motivation.

input: I just received my latest lipid panel results: Total Chol. 233, Triglyc. 75, HDL 51, LDL 167. My doctor is concerned about the LDL result but I read many articles about ratios between the numbers that are more important since they tend to differentiate "good LDL" vs. "bad LDL". Any comments to clarify? Thanks!
output: Hi, I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern regarding cholesterol levels. You have high LDL. LDL is bad cholesterol. It increases the risk of coronary heart disease. Same way HDL is good cholesterol its level 51 is optimal. But overall high LDL also increase the ratio of LDL to HDL. So it increases the risk. You should concern about your LDL cholesterol level. And you should start treatment accordingly. You can take Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions then you can ask me. I will be happy to answer.

output: Hi.noted history of gallbladder pathology. If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Definitive treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder along with the stones. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

input: my urologist recently told me i have an enlarged prostate and low flow urination. he gave me 8mg rapaflo about 30 days ago, i take 1 pill before bedtime. now i noticed when i have sex i do not ejaculate, it feels like im orgasming for a second or two, but no ejacualate. is this related to the enlarged prostate? my next drs appt is in 3 weeks
output: Your medicine could be the cause for the problem. It would be better to change your medicine to some other medicines for your prostate. The prostate problem itself does not usually lead to ejaculation problems. Take care and feel free to ask us again if need be.

input: My daughter is 33 years old has 1 child and a bruise keeps coming back on the curve of her back in the same spot. Very painful. It appears about every two weeks and then she gets a kidney infection. This has been going on for about 8 years. She has seen just about every specialist...No one knows.
output: Dear User, Im not surprised of these symptoms. In fact, bacteremia is often preceded by lumbar pain. Then, fever comes. On the other hand, maybe there is some kind of primary or secondary vesicalureteral reflux, that can be studied by either contrast voiding cystourethrogram (CUG) or radionuclide histogram (RNC). Then, depending on the abnormality (if any) demonstrated by CUG, there are several solutions, both medical or surgical. Let me know,

input: Hello. I m a 22 year old, male, college student. I get abdominal pain (like bloating ) if I concentrate intensely. The pain is more common while I m sitting and working/studying. The pain is also accompanied by moving sensations in my abdomen and gas. I have been having this trouble for the past 7-8 months. I went to a C.R.N.P but she could not diagnose anything specific.

input: Hi there, i have a very sore pimple on my nipple, it looks like a pimple only because it has become a small hole. the area where the pimple is has become sore, red and a little warm when i touch it. the side of my armpit hurts and also  sharp pains through to my arm. is this an infection? also i have breast implants under muscle.
output: Hello. Thank you for sharing your concern with us. It does sound like it might be an infection-the armpit hurting suggests that you might have some inflamed lymph nodes. The pimple that you are noticing now might have been there for a while and the small hole that you are talking about might be what is left of the pimple, which might have Chat Doctor.  I would suggest that you visit a doctor for a check-up and to have this problem looked into, especially since you have a breast implant. You might need some antibiotics to clear the infection, although the decision for antibiotics will be left at the discretion of your primary care physician. All in all, I think that it is better for you not to ignore the situation and to seek medical help with your primary care doctor. In most likelihood, it is just an infection and hopefully your symptoms will resolve with the appropriate treatment. I hope that my advice was helpful. Best regards

input: I m 39 and have been taking diovan for high blood pressure for 4 years. This past year I have gained about 30 pounds and I have had 2 or 3 episodes of high blood pressure. One example, I started having a headache after lunch and by 5pm I was at ER with 200/101. Doctors did several EKG s, blood work, stayed over night for stress test next morning, echocardio gram, xrays...etc. I followed up with cardiologist who suggested diet changes and recording BP. So now for about 3 months all has been good, but the last 2 days I am experiencing another episode . Headaches with 135/99 and 141/96. Could this be related to my menstrual cycle? I just ended this month s cycle. Just looking for answers that maybe could be related to something else.
output: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that the headaches do not seem to be related to high blood pressure, as your actual blood pressure values are within the normal ranges or slightly elevated. In my opinion the headaches could be related to the menstrual cycle or tension type headache. For this reason, I would recommend trying acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headaches. Regarding high blood pressure values, I would recommend trying to lose some pounds and perform a lot of physical activity in order to have lower blood pressure values naturally. Reducing salt and caffeine intake would also help. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,

output: Thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor. Further evaluation needed.what's your age? Height? Weight?are you take any sort of medication?viral serology>?ultrasound abdomen.

input: I had a broken tooth they had to do a root canal on.  Now the oral surgeon said the tooth on either side is dying.  They did a root canal on one and will probably do the other on Monday.  My concern is now a fourth tooth is feeling pain, the next one in line.  I wonder if I need to see an MD about nerve damage or bone issues.
output: Hello, I completely understand your concern about the toothache. Dental pain surely annoys you. Reading your question, I guess you have a high carries index which is why the dentist has suggested you for a root canal treatment. There would be a deep cavity in your tooth which is why you feel the pain. I do not suspect any bone or neurological damage. Get your dental x-ray done and depending upon the depth of the cavity, the doctor would suggest you to go in for a simple filling or a root canal treatment. The earlier you visit a dentist, the better it is ! Hope this helps. Take good care

One doctor says it could be tmj another says vertigo.... It just started 3 months ago ... I dont feel the room as a spinning affect but more like Im just light headed and going to pass out

The wisdom tooth on both the sides are in same inclined position but i have pain on only right side. This is creating a gap in between chew and wisdom teeth and causing cavity.

input: Hi! Im 27. We are married last 2011. We tried to get me pregnant about 2 months but no success till my husband left to work abroad. He came back and we tried but still no success. Iam a 33 days cycle and i mestruate every month. We consulted an obgyne she putted me on ovamit for 5days. Hubbys sperm count is normal. Do i have the abilty to conceive? And if theres a possibility to menstruate but no ovulation at all? Help! Thanks
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Not getting pregnant within two months of regular contact is not a big thing to be worried. If you are not able to conceive even after 6 months of regular contact then you need to go for investigations.  It is possible to have occasional ovulatory cycles in spite of you having regular periods. The frequency of sex during these two months also matters. Ultrasound examination for follicular study during the expected ovulatory period will reveal the presence of ovulation. Other factors like tubal block, cervical factors, Congenital anomalies, hormonal factors and immunological factors are to be investigated to find out the causes for infertility if you have not conceived even after 6 months. Wish you best of luck.  Chat Doctor. Morgan

output: Hello, She needs to be sent to the hospital for at least two reasons. One is that she will need good monitoring to rule out poisoning and serious problems related to this. She may have ingested even a higher number of tablets. The second reason is related to possible suicidal ideas, plans and actions. She may be having severe depression which may be causing her suicidal attempts. This is an emergent situation and needs prompt and fast intervention. I hope this answers your query.

input: 3 days ago I had a severe allergic reaction. I was eating grapes, apples etc from a Starbucks protein pack. All foods that I eat regularly. Following the allergic reaction I have felt fluish, with a headache, heartburn fatigue and nausea caused by strong sense of smell. Urine is also darker than usual Am not pregnant. 45 yr old female.
output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Allergic reactions can manifest in different ways, most commonly as skin rashes though abdominal symptoms can occur in some persons. Heartburn does not normally occur with allergies but in reflux which can also be associated with nausea. To determine if you are allergic to the fruits that you were using, you should consider an allergy test. This can be in the form of blood tests or skin prick testing. If the tests show that you are allergic to one or more of these then you would need to eliminate them from your diet. I hope this helps

Largest follicle measuring 1.2x1.0cm. Left Ovary: Left ovary measuring: 3.0x2.0cm(Showing multiple follicles). Largest follicle measuring 1.7x1.7cm.

output: So far the report seems to be normal as far as the development and maturation of the follicles is concerned. Now you have to keep a watch on when the follicle ruptures and the ovum is released. On that day, plan your intercourse to increase the chances of fertilization. If the follicle does not rupture, then probably your Gynecologist will give you an injection for the ovulation. Have intercourse the very next or same day of the injection. What about the rest of investigations like patency of the tubes, thickness of uterine lining, husbands sperm count, etc. Please keep me informed so that I can guide you further. You can contact me directly also, or through elite question.

output: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child Chat Doctor.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

input: Hi, I feel like I have air bubbles in my chest...  I find relief when I switch positions, but it comes back.  Ive also felt discomfort in my left arm and Im feeling very sluggish...  Im 36 years and im a little worried it could be my heart.  could it?  ive checked my pulse and its been normal...
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac diseases for your symptoms. So get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes gaseous distention can also give air bubbles sensations in chest. So take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily on empty stomach.Don't worry, you will be alright.

output: Hello, Thanks for the query. Your symptoms of spotting per vagina with pain abdomen is something to be concerned about.

input: I just came from the Oral Surgeon and he examined me for a small (no pain) smooth white spot in the vascular ducts on the underside of my tongue. He advised me to just continue to watch it and return in 3 months for reevaluation. I am trying to recall the name that he used to identify this spot. (something like Phibolist) He said it was a calcium deposit similar to a kidney stone. Do you possibly know the name of this stone?
output: Sialoliths may be the name mentioned to you. Have you been told that your salivary gland duct is blocked? Calcium deposits under the tongue are not uncommon. Your salivary flow is important to the health of your mouth. Salivary flow reduction can cause Chat Doctor.  Wharton's Duct is located under the tongue. You can try to stimulate the flow of saliva by sucking on something sour such as a lemon. Increased flow can push out calcium deposits and prevent the need for surgical removal. A Phlebolith, by definition, is a calcification in a vein or blood vessel. Vascular malformations may present with these. Sometimes, although present at birth, these may become prominent or increase later in life.  Swelling may become evident. The phlebitis may be seen on an x-ray. Additional studies including ultrasound and MRI may be required to determine vessel involvement. Hematomas are common with swelling, but less common with a phlebolith association in the mouth.

input: I was told I have kidney stones. this was a shock to me due to the fact I have no symptoms. I went to get an ultra sound because under my ribs was hurting bad and I had a lot of weight loss. They are having me strain my urine and all I see are little black things that look like splinters. what is going on
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, I can understand your anxiety. An ultrasound scan can detect stones in the kidney. A CT scan can accurately detect the stones on a plain film. An urine routine may give an indication of possibility of a stone. You need to get following blood tests done, in view of weight loss :1. Blood routine, RBS,LFT, creatinine and platelets.2. Fasting blood lipid profile, free T4 and TSH. You may send the reports here for an expert opinion.

input: Hi Doctor, What does hb level 5 indicates in blood . I ve been taking Ferro-f-tab (which contains elemental iron 100 mg & folic acid 350 mg) twice a day for the last two months. Does not seem to be helping me much. are there any MD doctors in Australia who can help? Could increase in dose of these tabs help or some injections or tonic. Thanks.
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Thank you for your query. A Hemoglobin level of 5, indicates anemia. The Ferro-f-tab has been prescribed to correct this. But in clinical practice a hemoglobin level of 5 would require blood transfusion for proper correction. Iron tablets do help, but usually take a long period of time and are mostly prescribed when there is border-line anemia. I suggest you discuss the possibility of a blood transfusion with your medical care provider. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications. Best wishes.

And what i need to eat, what type of vegetables is advisable to eat and now im doing sports exercises each day, i have hg 1.71 mtr , wt 77, thank you
output: Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. SGPT or alpine aminotranferase (A L T) is primarily found in liver. The normal value of A L T is 5-50 I U. In your case as this level is progressively increasing. Your food is healthy, and you are doing regular exercise that's a good thing. In my opinion get in ultrasound of liver with M R I so that exact reason of elevation of A L T (SGPT) can be found out. Consult a gastroenterologist and get his opinion as diet alone will not be able to cure this level. Good luck.

output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. He may have esophagus cancer.  If it is advanced stage then surgery is not possible.  Treatment of choice remains chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  For that you should go to fully equipped hospital with all facilities.  You can go to AIMS hospital or other and start treatment as early as possible. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

input: Arm tingling and numb,,little spider veins showing up above bicep, below rotator cup I have lifted heavy weights all winter and noticed just at the top of my right arm bicep little bluish spider veins that are continuing to expand around the area. my right hand and arm keep tingling and losing feeling as if e somewhere. ust woke up this morning with right arm numb and and feels like that arm alone has just been through a workout like it feels puffed and is also a darker color as if there is no good amount of oxygen getting to the arm or the blood flow is being cut off by a pinched nerve. But why are these little bluish purple veins showing up just below my rotator cup at the top of my bicep and seeming to spread every day I look at it?
output: Hi don't worry about vein as its normal. After some days of exercise or other work chance of change in size, position of vein is there. Normally they change its position .when u have good muscle mass, they need more oxygen so more deoxygenated blood in vain, so they look like more prominent

input: hi im 16 and my girlfriend is 14 and we had sex for the first time about a month ago few days after her period ended and we had sex 2 more times after that and we used condoms in all of the time and yesterday she told me that she didnt got her period yet and that she is late 5 or 6 days can you give a answer for that please we are freaking out!
output: Hello, First, having sex within 5 days after ending period is very much safe but using condom has near about 14% failure rate. Though, it depends on fertile period or ovulation time. On the other hand, 1-7 days period date alteration is normal thing and mostly occurs due to hormonal imbalance and stress/ mental upset. Therefore, I suggest her to wait at least 7 days to get normal period and if she does not get it, then she must undergo one home pregnancy test initially and later one blood test for beta-ChatDoctor to confirm or exclude pregnancy. Following test reports, consult with your doctor for next line of management. In the meantime, she must take balanced diet, avoid stress, Chat Doctor.  Be well & always practice safe sex.

input: I have had MGUS for two years, with mildly high calcium levels, also two painless lumps for two years in lymtph nodes in my groin, I have had a lytic lesion on my humerus in my left arm and recently, three weeks ago developed a golf sized lump on my forearm bone which is mildly painful. My doctor put the arm lump off as a bone spur but she did not have my medical records yet and didnt know I have had MGUS for years, Do you think this is anything I should have biopsied?
output: Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  If you have mugs from many years and recently develop lytic lesion and some lump then you have very high chance of developing multiple myeloma.  You should go for protein electrophoresis and biopsy of lump. If needed also go for bone marrow examination.  Then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

input: Hi I have went to the doctor because Im trying to conceive and Ive got sad news that my eggs are not releasing. I would like to know if I should give up the hope of becoming a mom or is there hope that there is something that I can do that will guarantee me that I will get pregnant. And also is my condition a very bad one?
output: Hi, Thanks for the query.  I have read & understood your query.  POD is a menstrual problem where ovulation is disturbed & so the menstrual cycle remains nonambulatory & irregular, thus posing a problem in conception.  This problem is seen more frequently these days being mainly a problem due to lifestyle changes.  * Still you need not worry, its methodical management can reduce its bad effects like infertility/ diabetes etc. To start with detailed physical examination / investigations (CBC, Thyroid function tests, USG with ovulation study, hormonal estimation, insulin resistance test)The treatment plan is then decided - - Weight reduction (regular exercises/ low calorie diet, are advised. A small amount of weight loss can correct the hormonal imbalance. Leaving smoking helps.  - Hormonal imbalance can be controlled with Cyclical oral contraceptives.  - Medicines like Metformin, Camphene are tried to stimulate ovulation - If nothing helps, surgical Chat Doctor.  * For this you should approach a gynecologist & after pathological tests.  Follow her instructions. You will get positive results.  Thanks.

input: I had a mitral valve repair in July of 2009. Last Wednesday at my annual physical my PCP said I had an abnormal EKG ( he said it showed a possible problem with the right side of my heart ). I have felt pressure in my chest especially when I exercise & just a little bit when at rest for about the last 6 weeks which I ignored until my EKG result. I have an appointment with my cardiologist in 9 days. What do you think are the possibilities? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.              Howard Watt
output: Hello, More and exact information about the status of mitral repair and the right heart will be available as we get a 2 D echocardiography done. The cause of the same depends on the reason why mitral valve repair was done. Generally the possibilities are 1) Higher lung pressure causing right valve leak, dilatation or decreased pumping 2) The repair has lived its time as its 7 years, and the disease might have progressed 3) Any new mitral disease 4) In previous era, tricuspid valve was not repaired even if it had moderate to severe disease considering its self healed after mitral repair.  So the same may have progressed 5) Fall in function of left beret post mitral repair. There can be Hun Chat Doctor.  The treatment for the same is based on etiology. Regards

input: Hi, Doctor, I am a healthy male of 50 yrs of age leading an active life as well as active sex life. About 5 yrs ago i remained without sex for about 20 days as i was abroad and on return one night after intercourse my wife discovered blood particles in my semen. Next day i visited my doctor and he had got all the clinical as well as pathological examination done, i also visited a urologist and after discussing my reports jointly they came to the conslusion that there in notinh serious and i was adviced to increase my sexual activities for some days and have to observe regularly about the presence of blood. Surprisingly the quantity of blood got reduced with each intercourse and after about one week it was clear. I was advised to remain sexually active or you can say not to put a big gap i.e. 10-15 days, if it happens i have been advised masturbation. After 5 years it happened again under the same circumstances. Is it a signal of a serious problem or is it a normal thing. Pl advise.RA
output: HelloThanks for query. You had blood in semen (Hematospermia) during sexual intercourse following abstinence for 3 weeks and was investigated thoroughly to detect the cause for same which turned out to be inconclusive, Normally during long period of abstinence there is stagnation of semen and sperms in reproductive organs (Epididymis, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory ducts etc.) resulting into congestion of these organs. Sudden release of pressure and congestion of these organs during first intercourse after incontinence causes what is called as rebound bleeding giving rise to Hematospermia.There's nothing to be worried about it. It is a normal phenomenon. Practice regular sex at least thrice a week to avoid such situation to recur again.  Chat Doctor.

input: Hi I got my wisdom tooth extracted about 2 weeks ago the extraction has healed but I can feel tiny hard lump with my toungue on the side of the extraction on the inner side of my mouth. its white and when I touch it with my finger it feels hard like a tooth or bone. Is this normal and if it is a piss of tooth will it come out on its own or will I need to get it surgical removed?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. Since you had an extraction of tooth, that tiny lump can be some bones edge or protrusion. In order to rule out remaining tooth fragment, I suggest you visit your dentist once and get a radiograph done. If it's a bony protrusion, it can be smoothened with a bone file. A tooth fragment (chances of which are minimum) can be judged according to position, if it requires intervention or will resort. Hope the answer helps. Thank you!

input: I have had a serious history of ankle sprains and have undergone two ankle ligament reattachment surgeries and have still been experiencing weakness and pain and last night had a pretty severe sprain again. It swelled pretty large, especially around the back and front of the ankle and now has gone down a little in swelling although still somewhat swollen and is fairly constant pain. I ve been icing today but do I need to see a doctor for x-rays, exam etc. ?
output: Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The symptoms seem to be related to a X-ray of the ankle to exclude a fracture. Meanwhile, I suggest using anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen to relieve the pain. I also suggest using cold compresses for local application. If the pain continues, I suggest seeing an orthopedist for further evaluation. Hope my answer was helpful. If you have further queries feel free to contact me again. Kind regards!  Chat Doctor.

input: I am having major pain in shoulders, neck and the back of my head. To the point where any movement almost brings me to tears. I am working and coping. But when I just bend down to pick something up or look in a direction where my neck doesn t want to turn it is very painful and I just can not continue doing the task. I have been going to PT getting massage, strength trainig and such. But I really feel it s coming from the back of my cranial traveling down my neck to my shoulders and downward. Any thoughts? Should I get a MRI?
output: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As after your history, I will advise to undergo an MRI of the cervical spine as the status of the soft tissue is must. Massage is strongly not recommended as you are doing all mixed up stuffs. Doing strengthening also and massage also will only make the muscle weaker. Also, just by mere working behind the blindfold treatment, I will advise to first take the MRI, and based on that, the combination of medication and physical therapy will work better. The physical therapist you choose, should know there is a difference between the patient to patient and symptoms to symptoms. A specialized plan for you should make a difference. Applying a conventional way of therapy will surely not function to the optimum. As, in my clinical practice I have seen cases with 100% recovery, but prior to that, the MRI, and the or tho prescription is understood for the pharmacokinetics of the Chat Doctor.  As this allows me to design a better physical therapy prescription and get 100% recovery. Slow and steady wins the race - this is our clinic principle. I wish to see you soon, with pain free lifeRegardsJay In

input: can a kidney stone in my right kidney be irritated by my golf swing and cause me to experience gross hematuria? Every time I play, hit balls at the range or just take a few swings for the monitor I pass blood in 24 hours. Then it goes away in a day or so. The stone is only 2mm. My urologist and internist don t seem to be concerned. Just let the stone pass. It s been 2 months and I m not aware of it passing. I have no pain. Just a sore lower back due to what I believe are my 3 herniated discs. Yet, sometimes my side/back aches during this bleeding.
output: Hello2 mm calculus is unlikely to cause hematuria(blood in urine). It is important to investigate other reasons like urinary tract infection(UTI), tumour etc. It is important to know your age. You need proper clinical examination and further investigations. Investigations include routine hologram, random blood sugar, urine RE/ME, renal function test. CT scan and endoscopic examination can be done if needed. Proper treatment depend upon findings.2 mm calculus is expected to pass spontaneously. Most probably, low backache is related to herniated disc. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor. 

input: Before getting out of bed and even before sitting up, I had a strange intense fluttering in my brain (more like shaking) and immediately followed by spinning of the room. I did get up after it passed. Within an hour, this happened three times and each time it was worse. When I tried to walk, my vision started shaking and I couldn t walk straight. I then started to vomit . Through the whole episode there was no head pain, only pressure and interior shaking on left side. What could be wrong?

input: Hello Doctor, My daughter is 10 and I had her in the ER this past thursday with abdominal pain, the ER doctor did an exam and was concerned that the pain was her appendix, however the cat scan was negative, my daughter has been running a low grade fever since then, the doctor admitted her over night for observation saying she did have a swollen gland on the right side of her abdomen and that since she was running a fever and the pain combined, they were concerned that this could turn infectious which in turn affect her appendix. When her normal pediatrician did rounds the following morning she felt that the stomach pain was due to her lactose intollerace and to modify her diet, however I am concerned because she still has the fever and some abdominal pain and her diet has drastically declined over the last few days, I am not sure how to procede from here to handle this, or am I just being overcausious.
output: Hi. You are not overcautious, you are right. Thanks for elucidate history and is definitely suggestive that the pain in a 10-year-old child unless proved otherwise in this case is due to the Inflamed lymph nodes on the right side of abdomen. I would advise going for blood tests - CBC for infection (WBC), Typhoid, a course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines for 7 days, Review with ultrasonography for size of the lymph nodes. IF same size-for for lymph node biopsy. IF responding to the treatment, continue medicines for three weeks. Also see for ENT - to see if whether has ENT infection, which on swallowing goes to the terminal intestines and affect the payer’s patches, which in turn enlarge the nodes - also called as Tummy Tonsils. No lactose intolerance can give lymph nodes.

input: I was wondering how I can get prescribed Valium by my doctor. I am a 19 year old Male and was prescribed 30mg Adderall XR in May of 2012 for my, just then diagnosed, ADD. I have always dealt with high anxiety, but recently it has gotten to a point that is distracting in my life. I am afraid to ask him and have him think I am some druggie, when I m not and I m afraid he d say something like the adderall is supposed to help with that. Please help! I am extremely stressed about this situation. Also, I think I may have generalized anxiety disorder but have never been diagnosed. Anything you can say about that would be GREATLY appreciated! Thank you!
output: Dear Dollie, Hi! Your concerns about your health are very natural. You have got all rights to discuss your health with your doctor including the need to take Valium. Actually for anxiety symptoms, though diazepam (Valium) will help you symptomatically, there are better options than taking Valium. Discuss with your psychiatrist about taking some SSRIs along with your routine Chat Doctor.  Also benefits of CBT and psychotherapy cannot be overemphasized for you. Trying seeing your psychiatrist soon and do discuss your concerns in detail with him/her. Hope I could solve your concerns.

output: Lipomas are firm, mobile, slow growing swellings which are benign. If the swelling is doubling in size rapidly and is hard and painful then it needs to be investigated. A clinical examination, ultrasound scan of swelling and a fine needle aspiration cytology of swelling should be done. Please consult your doctor.

You should consider freezing a good semen sample and using it to inseminate your wife during her ovulation time. Or the following step will be an IVF cycle. But don't go for these procedures unless it's been one year of unprotected regular intercourse.

input: Hi, I am very concerned.  I just was in the ED and had a CT scan and it read that I have a new cystic area on the right pelvic sidewall measuring 8.5cm in AP by 6.3cm in transverse dimension.  This measures 4.7cm in craniocaudad dimension.  Single septation.I have had a TSH and left oopherectomy and only the right ovary remains.  I am 45 years old and everything I am reading online is scaring me about the size of this cyst.I just had a laparoscopy in April to remove adhesions and this wasnt there.  How could a cyst grow that quickly?Is it a high percentage that large (>7cm) cysts are cancerous?  How can it be diagnosed as beneign or not?  is that only through laparoscopy?Thank you for any thoughts. I am very nervous!
output: Hi thanks for using Chat Doctor. Be relaxed. Only with the ct report we can't tell whether it is benign or malignant. We want more information. Best way to diagnose is to observe under microscopy about the cells characteristics. To diagnose whether it is benign or cancerous you can opt1. FNAC. Under USG guidance. One of the good way to diagnose solid tumors.2. Laparoscopy. Can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. The best way.3. Doppler scanning to see the blood supply. Non-invasive and can tell whether benign or cancerous. But not reliable. Hope this answered your question. Regards

input: I had the flu two weeks ago. I just caught what feels like a mini version. No fever, but I cough and have nasal drip and Im pretty weak feeling. Im on the third day of it. I am 34 years old, male. No health issues. I do feel my heart flutter once and while and just feel tired.. Is this a normal reaction to being sick?
output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that this feeling looks like a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia (an episode of atrial fibrillation or flutter, frequent ectopic beats or even ventricular arrhythmia, etc.). There is only one way to confirm any possible arrhythmic events, by means of ECG registering during such unpleasant feelings. The most appropriate option would be to undergo an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (Holder test). In addition, I would recommend you to perform a medical check up by your internist or cardiologist, for a comprehensive physical exam, a resting ECG, chest X-ray study, some additional lab tests like complete blood count, PCR, Thyroid, liver, renal function tests, blood electrolytes, etc., to rule in/out any possible flu complications, like thyroiditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, etc. that may lead to generation of cardiac arrhythmias and altered overall health status. A cardiac ultrasound would be necessary, if suspicions of myo-pericarditis, etc. are raised. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! 

input: Hi, I am 24yrs old female facing infertility problem. 4 years back I got a baby girl in my first pregnancy, after that I have not conceived due to PCOD problem. Recently I had Laproscopy as per my doctors suggestion and I am using medicines to conceive. My questions is I am using Duphaston from 14th day and Dubagest from 16th day. I have stopped Duphaston 1 week back and Dubagest 2 days back., My last period was 8th Jan, Can you please let me know when can I get my period if I am not pregnant., and If I am pregnant when can I go for the test?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. After stopping duphastone tablet if you are not pregnant then you may get periods within one week. If you are pregnant the test may be positive after 30 days /+ 1 week of your last period. i.e. after 8th Feb irrespective of you are taking duphastone or not. Taking duphastone doesn't affect pregnancy test result. Hope I have been helpful. Regards

input: I have a low grade fever 100-101, which I have had since Friday, along with congestion and sore throat(I have had my tonsils removed). Now my lymph nodes bilaterally are so swollen and painful it hurts to turn my head. My son had similar symptoms a week ago and tested negative for flu and strep. Should I continue to just ride this out as supposed virus?
output: Hello, the commonest cause for the symptoms you describe is viral infections.  Lymph node enlargement cane seen in both viral and bacterial infections. Low grade fever with more nasal congestion and other symptoms are suggestive of a viral infection. something like infectious mononucleosis. You have a contact history also.(your son) Strep infection would have high fever with other symptoms but less nasal congestion. Also, your throat will have white plaques or pustules.  You can have adequate bed rest, loratadine or fexofenadine, paracetamol, warm beverages, After 4 days if symptoms are not subsiding, get your blood tested.  Because if it turned out to be bacterial, strep needs antibiotics. Hope this helps. Thank you.

output: Hi. I can understand your concern. Ideally ECG and 2d echo should be done first in his case. If both are normal than no need to worry about heart diseases.

About 4 days after the fall my leg from knee to foot was swollen Broken bones in my foot and a blood clot in that leg have been ruled out. It is still swollen. Right after the leg and foot started swelling I kept it elevated above my heart many hours of the day as instructed by physician. I also took a round of antibotics and used an antibotic cream on my leg for a week. Are there any other tests that could be done to determine why it is still swollen?

In night again, she had little temparature. Day 3 - morning i gave T-minic syrup. Shall I give both (T-Minic and Crycin) syrup to get out of running nose and temperature. What should be dosage and course for the same ??
output: I am glad that you put up your query at Chat Doctor. I am sorry that your child is suffering from a respiratory tract infection which is a more technical way of saying common cold. The infection is indicated by the presence of fever which needs to be controlled by methods like cold sponging or medicines like paracetamol which are sold in brand names like Cronin, Cal pol, Pyrites etc. which is given at 15 mg/kg/dose. Such an infection generally has an allergic component associated along with, for which anti-allergics and cough syrups are given. Dominic contains Phenylephrine which is given at 0.2 mg/kg/dose 3 or 4 times a day. The amount in ml would depend upon the formulation of the syrup (medicine content in mg/ml). For giving medicines to a child, appropriate dosage is important as is the understanding of the actual condition. I strongly insist that you consult your pediatrician before using it. Your doctor would also be able to decide which medicines are to be given and whether antibiotics are to be prescribed along with.

Keeping the household humidity level at less than 50 percent to control dust mite and fungus growth.4. Using insecticides will help control cockroach populations. 5. Patients who are sensitive to mold, and outdoor air pollution should consider limiting outdoor activities when these levels are high. 6. Patients with asthma should avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.7.probiotic-supplemented yogurt resulted in reduced inflammation and reduced allergic symptoms8. Antioxidants vitamins C and E, selenium, and zinc. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, and other supplements such as the herb Parasites hybrids are also used to decrease inflammation.

input: I have been experiencing a clavicular fullness, neck fullness and jaw pain for the past few years ..been tested for everything (nothing lfe threatening).. all they found was an abnormality in my submandibular gland (cystic) and a ranula. In past few months under my tongue is swollen and VERY painful (pain radiates to jaw) the swelling (mouth floor and clavicular)and pain come and go and I cannot tolerate the pain and numbness /Tingling anymore, nasty taste after swelling goes down... after reading a lot ... how do the drs distinguish if it is a ranula or a plunging ranula? Should I be worried?
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The swelling below the tongue can be a cystic lesion arising from the sub lingual salivary gland which is called manual. If this manual permeates through the mylohyoid muscle and spreads down to neck region and produces swelling in the neck region below the mandible, it is called a plunging manual. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out, because infection arising from the teeth can also result in pain and swelling of similar kind. Get an ultrasound done to rule out the pathology. If it is diagnosed as manual or plunging manual, then it has to treated surgical to prevent complications like difficulty in swallowing, respiratory problems. The nasty taste can be because of the contents of the cyst which gets burst following any trauma to the cyst. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: why after 5 years of marriage never having pregnant... never event once,also never abort... theres any something that i should know about my self... me & my husband has been told by doctors that we are normal couple after been checked by them 2 years ago, already done IUI twice but nothing happens... what should i know regarding this problem?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. You and your husband are diagnosed as normal couples. There are still many problems which can cause infertility.  Like problem in fertilization of egg or problem in implantation.  Since you are trying from 5 years I would suggest you to go for IVF I.e. in vitro fertilisation.  Here the problem of fertilization is solved as in this procedure they fertilize egg outside, and then they place them into uterus. They place 3 to 4 fertilized egg into uterus. So chances of conceiving increase. This will help you. You can discuss with your doctor. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor. 

input: hi doc my age is 20 i am 70 kgs and my ht is 56 ....few months ago may be 2 0r 3 months.. i was on antibiotics (cephalosporins-cefuroxime) nd i think dats the reason i got yeast infection on my genital area.. m very not comfortable to talk abt dis to my parents and doc.. i searched online and got to know abt home remedies.. I came to know about sugarless yogurt.. would it really help me?Antifungals have so many side effects.. so why not any natural remedy?Thanks for your advice
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. First you need to control the fungal infection by using antifungal medication or creams. If it is itching severely, please take antihistamine tablets. Keep your genital area Chat Doctor.  Do not wear moist clothes. Try not to itch your genital region as this may spread the infection further. Sugarless yogurt will help treat yeast infections, but it may become messy for you. The antifungal cream is best option. Hope this helps

input: hello, i am generall a person who gains and looses weight over time recently ,for the past 8 months i have been having i-pills due to unprotected sex,and i also found that i have gained enormous weight,id like otknowif this is the side effects of the birth control i user to have lik ealmost 5 pills month please helpme or suggest me what i can do in order o loose this extra ponds of weight that has accumulated all of a sudden,i have stoped the pill now concentrating on loosing weight but reall tired to start.
output: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The frequent use of I-pill can be associated with the weight gain that you are having. This is a high dose hormonal pill and needs to be avoided. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.  

input: Hi, i am on the Contreceptive pill but forgot to take one, carried on as normal and then had an upset stomach a week later, and carried on taking my pill for another 3 days until my pill free week. i didnt have another pack to carry on with and didnt expect having sex any time soon. i ended up having sex but used a condom which later had spilt. after 28 hours i went for the morning after pill. now i am due on my period and i am 2 days late. im reallly worried that i am pregnant.
output: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  So, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case. In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.  You should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,

input: I have severe pain in my right arm from my neck to my pinky. my pinky twitches from time to time and my whole hand starts to swell. the pain is mainly in my elbow and down the backside of my forearm but it hurts all over. im going to a dr Tuesday but I was wondering if you could prepare me for what they might say
output: Hello, I have studied your case. Due to compression of cervical nerve root there can be pain in your fingers.Also, there can be large disc bulge which can be compressing over spinal cord. For these symptoms analgesic and neurotrophic medication like pregabalin can be started consulting your doctor. Till time, avoid lifting weights. You can consult physiotherapist for help. Physiotherapy like Tens and inferential therapy may give you relief for few days. In case of nerve compression leading to finger weakness you need to decompress nerve surgically. If nerve compression becomes symptomatically severe then surgical decompression will give permanent relief. I will advise you MRI cervical spine and EMG-NCV [nerve conduction study]. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.

Have had CT scan for lung clot..none there. all tests given in a resting position are normal.  under the care of a cardiologist but this heart pounding is debilitating.  doing research on my own now.  could it be due to extremely low estragin levels or some other hormone levels? First docs said I had Pericarditis and gave me Steroids for 6 days.  was pain free for a week and then it came back much worse for a week.  I dont fit into the easy answer diagnoses on this one.

He seems to be acting normally. However, he has a bump on the back of the head. Is it normal for the bump to hurt? How long will it hurt? Can he take a nap?

Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray 3. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, antihistamines inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Which med do you think is best or are both ok.  She also takes 4 blood pressure meds  and pravastatin.

Learn has been prescribed to her for depressed mood and to prevent mood swings. Donepezil is given for dementia for improvement in cognitive functions. In my opinion if she has severe dementia then she should be given Donepezil and also Seroquel and Learn. She is also taking Xanax which is a benzodiazepine Chat Doctor.  The 

input: I am in my mid-fifties and have a history of small warts, originally on my fingers. As of late I am finding little warts (with tiny tiny lessons) on my face. Also, a big light brown lumpy growth near the upper fore-head. I had one removed or lazer-ed off. It looks like it is starting to come back in the same spot, or close to it! I originally had the procedure done in Chicago, but now live in IN.......I really would like to take care of this, as it seems, the one in the middle of my face, to be growing a little bigger, but slowly. What should I do, or who can you highly recommend?

Pain in abdomin is a level 8 this evening. I am 38 years old 220 lbs and 5 11. What could this be and what can I ask of my PCP to get some answers and relief?
output: Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. The reason of the pain in the center of the abdomen and the back can be related to the Gastric Ulcer / Cancer or pancreatitis. Pain in the testicle may be unrelated to the pain in abdomen and may be due to orchids or so. No blood tests are suggestive of gall stones. Ask PCP the following:Get an ultrasonography. Upper GI Endoscopy and Colonoscopy, Blood: Liver function tests, amylase, lipase, CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment will depend upon the diagnosis, hence getting a right diagnosis is of utmost importance.

output: Hi, If you get an electric shock, you will definitely notice at least a tingling sensation and spread of the impulse along the path. The fact that you did not feel any impulse suggests that perhaps you did not receive any electric shock. There is no harm done in the current scenario to your pregnancy and so, please do not worry. It is also true at the same time that higher amounts of shock can lead to numbness, loss of function, loss of consciousness and threaten the pregnancy. Take adequate rest, healthy diet and regular follow up. Hope this helps.

output: Well, let us not try to "fix" anything! She is a human, not a leaky facet.

Encourage her to play and do interesting things to avoid getting her from being bored and tired. I hope this helps. Best wishes and praying for her speedy recovery.

It would also be good if you can get an MRI of your Brain done. Consult a physician with the reports who will be able to comment on them and advice you appropriately. Keep checking your blood pressure at least twice a week at different time periods. Hope this answers your query and do write back to us if you require further assistance. Wish you good health.

output: Hi. Thanks for your query. Since the check pregnancy tests is normal and MRI is also normal, it looks that you are not pregnant. Then the most probable cause of such a pain can be related to PID - pelvic inflammatory disease or enteritis as you have a white creamy stuff coming out. This is obviously not normal. Take an opinion of a Gynecologist for further investigations, diagnosis and treatment.

input: Hello so i am freaking out right now about some itching from my vagina all the way to my anus and above. On top of that I have small read bumps between my anus and vagina but closer to my anus. they are small but there are quite a few of them. And I have been constipated and had some bloating of the stomach with a little pain that accompanies it.
output: HI.... Thank you for asking Query. I read you problem, as I understood from what you said that you have bumps near to anus , having itching due to this, the bumps in this area can be due to simple bacterial infection, but some viral infection of this area can cause it, if they are filled with pus/fluid then bacterial infection can be the cause for it, some antibiotic ointment -Fucidin-can helpful apply time over it for 5-7 days, +some oral antibiotic like Tampico capsules can be taken for 5-7days if you donor have allergy to penicillin, not pregnant now-if married, as you did not tell your age, so the dose of medication need to be adjusted by local Chat Doctor. But if you have nearby GP, better to be examined by him/her. Hope you got the answer , you can freely ask any other query next. Regards

My husband does not enjoy sex using condoms .He has been asking me to get copper-t inserted.I want to know the procedure of insertion, it s side effects and how painful it can be during insertion and after insertion.when is the best time to insert it?
output: Hi, Cooper =T is an intrauterine device inserted by OG inside your uterus. Usually, there is no pain during insertion. After insertion, some women have reported pain or cramps together with heavy periods. If you notice unusual symptoms can consult OG or physician immediately. Be careful when having sex not to remove the Cooper-t to avoid laceration of uterus. It can be inserted any time, but usually after the periods are over. All the best! Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi, I just found out my ALT is 146 and my AST is 85. Last month it was only AST 66 and the ALT was the same. They have tested me for Hepatitis and that is negative. I only have 2 drinks a night and am currently on amoxicillin for a tooth infection. what can make my levels so high? I am currently 20 pds over weight, can this be the reason?
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. You probably have condition called fatty liver. This is caused by metallic syn Chat Doctor.  These are not very elevated findings, and it should be treated only by changing dietary and lifestyle habits. I suggest you to do ultrasound to see is thee any liver damage. Lose some weight, avoid alcohols, soffee, smoking, fats and follow some of hepatic diets. Repeat lab tests 2-3 months after that, and I am sure there will be improvement.  Wish you good health.

input: Hi, my brothers been suffering from xdr tb for probably 2 years now, d doctors say about 60% of his lungs are damaged...he constantly complains about tightness in his chest , and a feeling of been suffocating. I understand treatment at this stage is a very slow process, but for how long is he going to keep feeling this way? It causes him great discomfort. Does higher altitudes have anything to do with his quick recovery and the suffocating feeling? Thanks
output: Since you say he has damage to his lung, that area could harbor the bacteria and might even have lung abscess. You might even consider surgery to take away some part of the irreversibly damaged lung so that the rest of the area heals well. A thoracic physician/surgeon will be helpful in this regard.

input: What is the least amount of time you can take amoxicillin  for a tooth infection and still be sure the infection is gone? After two days of taking the medication he will have a root canal, would three more days after the root canal be adequate?  My husband has just gotten over a very severe case of C Diff. after taking clindamycin for a tooth infection six and a half months ago.  It has been only three and a half months since recovery and now must go on amoxicillin 500mg Q12hours,( he also has 4th stage kidney disease thus this specific dosage), for a new tooth infection.  We want to take every precaution that safely addresses clearing up the infection and also all we can do to prevent another C Diff. occurrence!!  Thank You!
output: Hello, Its better to administer amoxicillin initially, prior to root canal treatment. This will help to relieve the underlying infection. I would suggest you to take complete course of antibiotics during the initial stages of tooth infection. Depending on the severity of infection, dose as well as duration of action of antibiotics may vary. Please do visit a dentist and get an opinion regarding this. Hope this helps.

input: hi, i want to know about DTP vaccine. my baby is of 1.5 month. please suggest i should go for painless or painfull DTP vaccine. I also want to know what all problem baby suffers from if i go for painfull vaccine? please suggest what will Painless vaccine cast me?
output: Hello, The painless DPT vaccine contains cellular pertussis and has fewer side effects in terms of fever, swelling, pain etc. This vaccine came into use a few years back, but now recent data suggests that this vaccine is not very effective against pertussis (whooping cough). There have been several outbreaks of whooping cough in America and now this vaccine is no longer routinely recommended. You should get your child vaccinated with the whole cell pertussis vaccine or the so-called painful vaccine. The commonest side effects of this vaccine are fever, pain at injection site, swelling at injection site and irritability. There are other extremely rare side effects like fits, shock. The painless vaccine is now recommended only for those child Chat Doctor.  The cost of painless DPT vaccine is around INR 1500 - 2000.  Hope that helps. Preeti

input: Hello, I am a healthy, 42 year old. I have regular 27 day periods and seem to ovulate regularly. I had low TSH in the past year that is now corrected. I had a miscarriage 3 days ago. My ultrasound showed an endometrial lining thickness of 6mm today (day 3 ). Is that normal? Also there were 5 follicles shown at approx 8mm. Is the lining too thick? What are my chances of concieving again this cycle? Very fertile in the past. Only issue has been some thick lining. Thank you, Annabelle
output: Hi Annabelle I think your endometrial thickness is a bit on higher side, but it is day 3 only. You can bleed and have a thinner lining on day 5. So there is a fair chance of conceiving this cycle also. But you need to take some medicines to support your pregnancy as you had miscarriage in the past.  Talk to your doctor regarding this. Hope I have answered your question.

input: I have a red spot just above my left ankle about 4 inches in diameter which has been there ever since I had a large cancerous tumor removed from my left groin about three years ago. I have used various medicated creams on it but it does not go away. I have light shooting pains in it occasionally. I recently sprained my ankle and it got worse. I am 92 years old and diabetic. Is there some medication or medicated cream that might help?

input: My baby is 3 months and she just threw up a small amount with brown colored mucous-like throw up in it. It was about the size of a silver dollar. Should I be concerned. She has never done this before. I checked her temp and it is normal and no behavioral cues.
output: Hi... if the baby is feeding normally and otherwise active you need not worry about this. Red flag signs if something sinister is going on in the baby at this age would be - 1. Stoppage of feeding completely.2. Fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit.3. Respiratory distress and fast breathing.4. Abnormal spontaneous bruising on the skin. Regards -

input: Hi Dr. s I got my semen analysis a few days ago, rest all is normal excelt on thing i.e. my sperm has a -3 grade which is fast but undirected movement. Does this need any treatment? If so what sort of treatment should I get? Is this a cause for not getting my wife pregnant? I am married since last 4 years and my wife had 3 miscarriages and the last one was 1 and half year ago.

input: My 3rd old has had a little big of blood after wiping, we were told to change his diet. More fibre etc, today him after he had a BM there was bright red blood & quite a bit... Really worried any advice?? We are making an appointment with his DR tomorrow..
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The problem that your child is facing is not commonly seen in this age group. Bright red blood and increased quantity is not suggestive of infection alone, and I am thinking of a surgical cause a possibility. Most probably due to some injury at the exit point of the stools. You Need to consult doctor at the earliest, and you might need to meet a pediatric surgeon too. Wish your child a good health. Take care.

input: I have a small lymph node in lower area of left side of my neck. I have had a seriously swollen shoulder from rotator cuff problems. Can this be a cause of the node? I had a Pet 6mths ago and it has slightly enlarged. I suffer from awful sinus drainage and clering throat because of it. I am so afraid it is cancer. PET this Friday. I hhave been in remission for 6yrs Dr. says it is not likely to be that. I can t stop mashing to find this thing. Help.
output: You said you are in remission now. That means you must be having history of cancer. If you have history of cancer biopsy of the enlarged node needs to be done. Else you can take a course of antibiotics and wait till sinus discharge subsides. Cervical node enlargement occurs with throat infection and other head and neck infections commonly. In such case you can wait.

input: my sis has high creatinin level of 111, her left kidney has parenchymal disease and she had a right kidney stone removed from years back though current result proves that her kidney is clear. she wants to know what are the dos and donts and what are the risks for having this high level of creatinin and parenchymal disease, what important things do we need to ask from her doctor if we have her checked up. thanks alot. god bless.
output: Firstly I would like to correct that it is 11.1 mg /DL of see. Creatinine and not 111. If the see. Creatinine levels or this elevated for a long time and is asymptomatic I suggest having an AV FISTULA created at the earliest. She may land up any time in uremic seizures, her bones will be brittle n prone to fractures, she would be having loss of appetite and muscle catabolism due to chronic acidosis. Regarding diet absolute vegetarian diets low in potassium. Avoid fruit juices and fruits especially banana, watermelon ... Can have small bites of apple, guava and papaya. BUT GET FISTULA DONE EMERGENTLY COM IT TAKES 6 WEEKS FOR IT TO MATURE AND ANY EMERGENCY DURING THIS PERIOD SHE WILL HAVE TO TAKE EMERGENCY DIALYSIS WITH ITV ACCESS WHICH IS PRONE TO COMPLICATIONS OF INFECTIONS.

input: Hi, I have just banged my leg on the corner of my coffee table. Below the right knee to the right hand side, It actually brought tears to my eyes. It came up in a bruise straight away an now there is a hard round lump underneath the bruise. is the lump anything bad do you think?
output: Hi, The lump is a normal occurrence after this type of injury. There will be swelling and bruising which will have caused blood to collect in the area causing the lump to appear. It may last a few days before receding. In the meantime, take paracetamol and ibuprofen for the pain. Keep your knee moving with your normal daily activities otherwise it may become stiff. A compression knee support may help. Also try a cool compress to the area. Hope this helps you.  Chat Doctor. 

input: My father has malignant melanoma and has recently undergone the gamma knife for his brain mets. Today he woke up with multiple blueish black lesions on the skin under the arm that he originally had surgery on for the infected lymph nodes 18 months ago. He has no pain there, but they were not there yesterday. Is this more mets?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of metastasis is more. Malignant melanoma is known to cause skin metastasis and maxilla is common site for metastasis. So bluish black skin lesions can be due to skin metastasis. So get done clinical examination and if needed biopsy of the lesion to rule out metastasis. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks.

input: I have been diagnosed with GAD since recovering from prostate cancer & possible duodenal cancer that was determined to be non malignant both within the past 2 years. I have tried 5 different SSRI s and 3 different SSNI s, none of which provided any relief. Side effects for most made my anxiety worse. I have also seen 4 psychiatrists with some minor success. CBT offering some help, the others, EMDR & Talk Therapy very little. The only relief I get is with 1MG Lorazepam as needed with no side effects. Why all the negativity re this medication.
output: Hi. I understand your situation. Keeping myself in your shoes and with previous experiences with these therapies in cases of anxiety and depression with aggravation SSRI, I would suggest either NLP or sunk six I acupuncture. NLP practitioner are available all over the globe. If you do not have access to any practitioner than you can read the best books I came across this topic - unlimited power and awaken the giant within. Both by Anthony Robbins. These are life-changing books and I highly recommend them from personal as well as patient experience. Six I acupuncture is different from Chinese acupuncture. It utilises very small needles with very small insertion depth only on palms. For emotional issues six I acupuncture is one of the best techniques to change the whole Constitution of the person. If am not sure which country you belong, but there are sunk association from Moscow who can probably guide you don't practitioner in your area. Hope this helps. Good luck

input: My right side hurts, but not really low. Kinda in the middle. But it only hurts when I sit down, stand up, cough, any sudden movement like that. It feels like something s being jiggled out of place and the pain is a sharp twinge. It started as a normal stomachache then moved to my right side.
output: Hello, As the location of the pain isn't mentioned it is difficult to put a comment which is directed towards the pathology. As you mentioned the stomachache and pain moved, I suspect it to be the higher side of the lower back where you are getting pain. This can be due to organs compression over the muscular system. A diagnostic ultrasound scan will help to figure out the actual organ pathology and medicine will be prescribed based on that. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

He underwent blood work, dx with Impaired fasting glucose under control by diet & exercise.
output: Hello, It's important to ascertain the giddiness you describe is actually not minor episodes of seizures. The headaches may be associated with it. Please get the opinion of the Neurologist who will be able to rule out Seizures and decide whether you need to start on medications again. A repeat Brain Imaging might be necessary to determine about Granuloma or other causes which can lead to seizures.

input: I ve been going to the gym (cardio and weights) I have a slight pain on the right side with a lump type feel. It is located right below my ribcage. when I was on the elliptical yesterday my heart rate went up to 155 during the tough workout. should I be concerned.
output: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As to let you know one of the primary act is thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised and also the cardiac clearance before undergoing gym. It is on a safer side to get clearance and then proceed. As mentioned by you that you have a pain under the rib cage or below it, it could be most of the time a muscular pain. Due to overtraining there will be a sudden muscle spasm due to stretch contract mechanism on the elliptical. Taking a rest with hot water fermentation should reduce the pain and after 3 days you can go back to gym. Also, if the pain doesn't come down, than taking up a thorough musculoskeletal and cardiac assessment is advised on a safer side. Since you have discomfort on the right side, the worry is less, may be just a muscle spam on the right Hyperion Chat Doctor.  It should subside in short time. This is on of the common injury in gym, as the body is not prepared to undergo the stress & strain on the muscles. Undergoing slow and steady training under guidance will help avoid such injuries in the future. RegardsJay In

input: hello my 5 month old grandson is being sent to a specialist for high levels of calcium and something about his thyroid. He was big when he was born and he s big now he weights 21 pounds and he cries a lot not as much as he used to. They thought he might have acid reflux but ... anyway what could it be? Nothing serious serious I hope
output: High calcium levels, or hyperkalemia as it is called, may be caused due to excess of certain hormones secreted by the parathyroid glands which are small dot like structures on the wall of the thyroid gland. Treatment depends on the magnitude of the problems caused. Appropriate HY Chat Doctor.  A vitamin D derivative called calcitonin can be given. Dialysis or destruction of the parathyroid glands may be required in more extreme cases. Please remain in the follow-up of your doctor, and he will be better able to explain the gravity of the scenario and its management.

input: Me and my boyfrnd were having sometime togthr sexually. he did not enter me fully. but we just tried putting the penis tip into my vagina. he came after taking it out. (we are sure about that. ). there was some cum above my pubic region but not anywer near to my vagina. and also it was a dry process. i was not having any lubrication at all. is der ny chance of getting pregnant? we also came to knw abt the precum and its chances to make pregnant. we r little worried. kindly give an answer as soon as possible.
output: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there are rare chances of pregnancy. Usualy there is scope for pregnancy when semen is ejaculated inside the vagina during the fertile period. There is very rare chance when then semen outside the vagina resulting in pregnancy. Byt anyway confirmation is done by a urine pregnancy test. The test needs to be done a week after missed period if at all the period is missed. The first sign of pregnancy is missed period. Other signs of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period In case of pregnancyAnyway overall the chance of pregnancy is very rare. So avoid stress and wait and check for the period. Hope this helps. Best regards...

input: I am always tired, exhausted. I can t walk up stairs without getting out of breath and feeling like I m about to pass out. (I ve been diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension??.) I feel like everything drains out of me when I walk, even slowly, upstairs. Even if it s only a few steps. I m breathing hard, hr goes way up and I feel like my blood pressure plummets.usually can t stand up straight until it goes away and feel like my legs are going to give out on me. Also if I squat down everything starts to go black when I stand back up. All my labs are normal and cardiac said my heart is fine altho it did show some tachy some brady and pvc s. My EKG showed a short PR. What is wrong with me??
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult cardiologist and get done1. 2d echo2. Stress test3. Holder monitoring (24 hour recording of ECG)4. Coronary angiography SOS (if required). You are having irregular heartbeat with orthostatic hypotension, this suggests possibility of arrhythmia or coronary artery disease (CAD). So better to get done above investigations first and diagnose yourself and start appropriate treatment. So consult cardiologist and discuss all these.

input: I am a generally articulate person, but recently I feel as if i am unable to find the exact words to express my thoughts in a timely manner, and sometimes have to restart sentences multiple times; someone told me these could be symptoms of pregnancy? If I were pregnant it would be less than a month since conception, so would these symptoms arise that early?
output: These symptoms can occur in early pregnancy, but first you need to confirm your pregnancy by a urine test or an ultrasound

input: Hi, I need an advice regarding the possibility of being pregnant. I m a virgin. Me and my boyfriend were messing around yesterday somewhat and things got a bit *hot*. We didn t have penetrative sex, but he fingered me and I gave him a handjob. He touched his penis- while pulling it out of his pants- but then I immediately started giving him a handjob so the contact was brief and I don t think there was any precum as his penis was not even fully erected yet. After a few moments he began unzipping my jeans, etc (so he definitely has brushed his fingers against my clothes) and then fingered me (but not very deep). Also it was day 21 of my cycle (usually my cycle varies from 27 to 31 days, so I guess my ovulation should has happened already). I understand that chances of me getting pregnant are very low but still... should I be worried?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about pregnancy. For pregnancy, Intercourse in vagina and ejaculation of semen in the vagina is must. This should be happened during Fertile period (ovulatory) period of your cycle. Since you don't have Intercourse in vagina and you're were not in your Fertile period, no need to worry about pregnancy. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

output: Hello, Let me tell you that NICAP is an anti-inflammatory analgesic agent, and it can relieve pain and inflammation, but it can not cure the boil. I suggest start taking Definite tablet twice daily for three days, and you are also advised to do hot fomentation on the boil 2-3 times daily. It will help relieve the symptoms and cure the boil.

output: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Discharge from an infected area would contain a mixture of pus and blood, so it is not unusual that blood was present in the abscess.

output: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You mostly have posterior cervical lymph node enlargement. ITIS due to some infection in head and neck area.

Since his recent sickness, he hasn t felt right and now says it feels like he is breathing through cobwebs or cotton candy, fiberglass type of feeling in the upper part of his chest. Some days are worse than others. What could this be?
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your husbands situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion he might be having worsening of underlying asthma and bronchitis. Lung infection is the most common cause for worsening. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray 3. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out worsening of bronchitis. He may need antibiotics, antihistamines and additional inhaled bronchodilators for better symptomatic relief. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks.

output: Hi, As per your query, your child has symptoms of runny nose and sneezing which is due to upper respiratory infection.  Need not worry. I would suggest you visit Pediatrician once and get it examined. You should get routine blood tests done to check the level of infection and start treatment accordingly. You should avoid the use of spicy, sharp oily and fried food substances. Furthermore, you should take a combination of antibiotic Levofloxacin along with anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, you should avoid cold carbonated beverages. Apply mist humidifiers in the room. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I believe I have acid reflux which is affecting my gums and teeth.  I am scheduled to have eight teeth and toris removed this wednesday.  Do you see a problem having the oral surgery done?
output: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. In acid reflux the teeth will get damaged secondary to the acid attack on the teeth resulting in erosion of the teeth. If sufficient tooth structure is there, then we can save the teeth by doing RCT. If the tooth structure is not there then it has to be removed. The teeth can be removed and Tori can also be removed but the antibiotics and analgesics should be of lower dose since this will cause gastric irritation and may cause vomiting and heart burn or gastric pain. Even the painkillers prescribed after the surgical procedure can worsen the acid reflux. So be careful and take precautions like antacids at regular intervals before the medications prescribed after surgery. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

input: Hi I have had a breast lump remove under general anaestic 5 days ago . I feel the same as I did when I came out of surgery Physically Fatigued! Im a very active 54 year old have a text booked blood pressure, I cant do daily shores or go back to work. I have difficulty getting out of bed and even having a shower!! Which Im fanatic about!! Please help!!
output: Hello! Thank you for the query. Please note that any surgery is an immense effort for whole organism. We can compare it to taking part in car accident for example. So this is a typical reaction for surgery. Your body needs to rest to get back to normal. It takes time and It's hard to accelerate it. So if you do not feel any part of your body weaker (like one leg or arm is weaker), no headache, no dizziness and pale skin, your heart rate is lower than 100, rest is all you need. If any of mentioned symptoms is present, you should consult your doctor right away as stroke or anemia are possible. Hope this will help. Regards.

input: worried about blood pressure for the last week as high as 160/104. Was normal one month ago at docters office. I am 50 years old, normal weight and healthy on vegetarian diet and exerise every day.Do have family history of high blood pressure, mother had problems starting about 40 year old    Should I have this checked out or give it some time?
output: Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain, you are 50 years old, and you do have heredity for hypertension. According to this, I think we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long. In most cases' people with hypertension does not have any symptom but leaving this values untreated slowly modifies your heart muscle. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h, to know your mean values day and night. A cardiac echo to evaluate heart chambers and a fool blood analyze. After having a fool view of the situation we can decide how to treat your hypertension. But my opinion is that you should do this thinks now and not leave them for the future because it is much better if we act and treat hypertension faster in time. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.

input: I woke up yesterday morning with a few red bumps on my lips & hands let it go for a few hours and my whole body was covered but my mid- stomach& back and my lower legs. Ive been treated for allergic reaction since I was a kid due to contact with certain soaps & etc.. I get a steroid & Benadryl next day it usually cleared right up. This time I  Went to the doctor this and told her the only things Ive done differenly at home is bought a new scented dryer sheet and I used rubbling alcohol on my face the night before as well as using hydrogen peroxide as a oral rinse. She than prescribed me prendisone for it for a week. 40mg -2days than 30mg 2 days and so on till its gone. Its been 24 hours and my rash isnt any better & seems worse, Im extremely, nauseous & very tired and irritable is this normal if not what should I do???
output: Hi, rash following contact with a new antigen is presumed to be allergic. You should at least have responded to steroid by now. Since there is no response, the possibility of other causes of rash like a viral rash should be considered. Watch out if you develop fever or pains. If that happens, revisit your doctor.

I have heard so many "horror stories" about the surgery that I am afraid to have it done. Can they do the laparoscopic surgery on me if I am overweight? I watched the procedure being done on youtube and I noticed that they place three clamps on the duct before cutting it loose. Do these stay in the body or are they removed? How risky is the surgery and what are the possible complications? How long is the recovery time because I have a two year old son to care for?
output: Hi, Your symptoms may be suggestive of gallbladder stones, so you should do at least ultrasound or CT scan to evaluate it more accurately. This is caused by stone in bile duct and is very common condition.  You need to change your dietary habits first. You need to avoid fried food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  Furthermore, you should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food. If there is no improvement on lifestyle or dietary changes, then surgery is recommended. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards,

input: i have a pain the is becoming increasingly worse in the last day, it feel like a pulled muscle ( i m very active) however it is tender to the touch also if I cough it hurt. Its located under my lower rib cage and continues just below.. if I squeeze my side I can fill the tissue is tighter has a know,, maybe I have a knot in my oblique? but why is it getting worse
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. But we need to rule out pneumonia as it can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and chest pain on coughing. So get done chest x-ray first. If chest x-ray is normal then no need to worry about pneumonia. You are having chest pain due to excessive coughing. So start antihistamines for suppression of cough. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, you will be alright.

input: Had dental  procedure six days  ago. I am resistant to  the local anesthetics and required quite a bit  more  ( 7 injections) to eliminate pain, was a little foggy  when I left there.  ( this resistance  is normal for me).  I had a perio  cleaning, a molar extraction, and a bone graft implanted.  The dentist closed with stitches.  Because I had  a perio  deep cleaning on the other side of my mouth and have an aortic valve  surgery scheduled in a month, I have been on amoxicillin for 2 weeks and just finished that today.  Note that I do not get headaches.  Ever.       After the extraction, I have not had pain or  problems with the wound itself , nor fever or sickness, however, I have had a mostly-pressure headache constantly for the entire week, and it does not seem to be lessening.  It is not sharp like a migraine must be, but I  also seem to have a  light-sensitivity going on as well as the tension-type headache.
output: Hello, Your surgery is still considered recent, and you are in an initial healing stage. It is not uncommon for you to experience some discomfort. Take anti-inflammatory medication and finish all medication as prescribed. Report your condition to your treating dentist. This is the best recommendation for evaluation post surgery. Upper extractions and surgery raise some concern if there is a sinus complication during the healing process. Do you experience any congestion in your sinus area?  This can explain a pressure headache. It is not unusual to experience a pressure sensation with a large amount of inflammation after multiple dental procedures. Again, anti-inflammatory medication may help you deal with this discomfort and your discomfort should continue to decrease with time. There is greater concern if you feel this condition is worsening. Thank you for your inquiry. Please schedule a follow-up visit with your dentist.

input: My daughter-in-law had a baby 2 months ago. At that time she had a prolapsed Uterus and started hemorrhaging. She was given 4 units of blood. She now is having severe breathing problems but all the pain she is having has now moved to right below her Right shoulder blade and around her upper right quadrant.
output: Hello, Most probably it will be a contusion or musculoskeletal pain. As of now, you can use analgesics/anti-inflammatory combination like diclofenac/serratiopeptidase for symptomatic relief.  If symptoms persist better to consult an orthopedic and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. 

input: Dear Dr Lundi,Hello. I am nineteen years old and for the past few years I have been having these sudden sharp, pin-pricking pain in my left breast only. These are not related to my menstrual cycle. Theyre totally random. Just comes out of nowhere and goes away suddenly as well. Also I have this clear watery fluid coming out of my left nipple and occasionally the right one, ONLY on squeezing them. I also have these two tiny lumps joined together, painful when pressed, in my left breast. Ive noticed them for about a couple of years now, and there hasnt been any change in their size.  I had a mammogram done of my left breast but the reports were normal. I am really scared if its breast cancer. I would appreciate some help.Thanking you.

input: Should a person see a doctor if they have a large (1 1/2 round by 3/4 high) hematoma on the cheek bone caused by a fall? What can be done for it? Will it dissipate by itself? If so, how long should it take? What kind of doctor should this person see?
output: Hello, Hematoma is nothing but a collection of blood. Generally, it will settle by itself in three to four days. As of now, you can apply ice packs for symptomatic relief and faster recovery.

input: Hello,I am looking for a solution to my severe jaw and temple pain. I recently got a crown put in on my right lower molar, it has been nearly two weeks and Im still experiencing severe jaw pain. Im having trouble opening my mouth to eat and Im taking 800 mg ibuprofen for the pain but as soon as it wears off, the pain is unbearable. Ay suggestions?
output: Hello there, Thanks for writing your query, Pain in the jaw and temple area post crown placement on the tooth indicates problem with the crown coverage. If the prosthetic crown is not in CAUSAL HARMONY with the jaw it leads to pain and discomfort during chewing and clenching. The crown needs to be evaluated for any high points and sharp margins that interfere with the normal occlusion. Consult a dentist and get the crown examined, SELECTIVE GRINDING of the crown will help in resolving the problem. I hope this helps, take care.

input: my left and right foot keep twitching. It doesnt actually move, it just feels like the muscle is randomly contracting and relaxing. Ive not experienced any other symptoms. This twitching started at night about a week ago and now occur randomly throughout the day.
output: Dear patient muscle twitching is common sign of deficiency of serum calcium i.e. hypocalcemia. It is also common in patients with anxiety and stress. Are u anxious or in stress? Does this twitching occur only when you are free and thinking over? If yes its sign of anxiety. I would like to advise serum calcium levels to rule out hypocalcemia. Meanwhile start tab shell 500 mg twice a day with tab Clairol 60000 units once a week for 4 weeks. Visit to your nearby physician will be helpful.

My Dr is in Raleigh, NC and I just moved to Atlanta, GA a couple of weeks ago. My Dr in Raleigh said it was imperative that I seek a Dr here in Atlanta or neaby. Can you recommend a Dr to me.

input: Have right foot pain for approximately two weeks, on 2/28 my foot pain woke me in the middle of the night. My foot was very swollen and tender to the touch. Went to the ER, doctor diagnosed me as having Gout, took my blood and wrote me a prescription for indomethacin. At my follow up visit with my regular doctor, she said no way gout , blood is below the range and u don t fall in usual gout criteria. Took X-rays of the foot, no broken bones. Now is sending me to podiatrist, what is wrong with it?
output: Hello, Did you have a history of trauma, fall, or long walking or running lately? From the information you gave, the first diagnosis that comes in my mind is arthritis of the foot bones, could be mid-foot, forefoot or hind foot. Normally, in the x-ray that you did arthritis should have been visible. The second option is stress fracture of foot bones, but only if you had prolonged walking or running recently. This cannot be seen on x-ray, but only on bone CT scan or scenography. There is even more rare disease such as infection or tumors that need to be distinguished. Maybe the podiatrist will order these examinations and blood work for you to diagnose and treat your condition. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: hellomy wife was told that her ultrasound showed an unremarkable cyst or growth and her doctor said that it was small. She has been experiencing back pain at the end of her period, other than that she has no other symptoms. She had 2 CA125 tests that showed her protein to be high. Can this be due to cancer or are there other reasons for these results?
output: Hi, Ovarian cyst is a common phenomenon. Ultrasound can reliably differentiate between a benign ovarian cyst with some other suspicious ovarian tumors. CA-125 very often increased in many non-malignant causes. Mastectomy may be an option in treatment of ovarian cyst, but that can be decided by your gynecologist. If any suspicious lesion is found on imaging more radical surgery should be done and pathology report should be obtained. Consult your gynecologist.

input: When I get extremely upset, which is not often, I experience a tingling sensation on the back of my scull. Recently it happened but this time I felt it all over my whole body. Its not painful it just feels like the sensation you might feel if your foot falls asleep. It goes away when I calm down. What could be causing this? Am I having a panic or anxiety attack? Should I see my doctor and if so will he be able to find out whats wrong if it is in fact a physiological condition? I have an iron defficiency, but im otherwise in good health.
output: Dear thank you for sharing with us your health problem. Iron deficiency cant explain the symptoms you are experiencing. My recommendation is to explore thyroid function (T3,T4,TSH) if there come normal than you are experiencing a panic disorder. You should avoid caffeine Chat Doctor.

You have already seen the urologist and undergone all the necessary tests, prostate, X-rays, ultrasound yet the diagnosis was unsure. So the Urologist gave you a long courses of antibiotics, but the pain is here again 7 on a scale of 10. The pain in the testicles and abdomen with feeling of heaviness indicate that there may be either a local problem which can be diagnosed by MRI of the scrotum. If there is a doubt, there is always a chance to take a second opinion of another Urologist or a senior General Surgeon. Scrotal support to elevate off the weight is also needed.

input: can severe pain and mild swelling with warmth central located in the most tender spot, be torn rotator cuff. and exhibit serious pain 8 months after a serious fall which resulted in a broken shoulder on opposite side. I have unexplained pain 10+ scale. Regular xray yesterday showed no fractures, no arthritis. Can you get a rotator cuff tear and have no symptoms and then with out additional injury or unusually use begin exhibiting pain as severe as the broken extremity from last Halloween
output: healthier is difference in rotator cuff tear and supraspinatus tendinitis, whereas in former the movement of shoulder is impaired especially abduction and rotation while lifting arm sideways, in tendinitis there is pain and movements may be painful and not restricted as such, an MRI may distinguish the two. So consult a shoulder surgeon or orthopedic surgeon. In your case, it may be tendinitis. Take Advil thrice a day after meals for 7 days and do hot fomentation, rest arm in a broad arm sling for 10 days., it may help but if not go to orthopedic doctor for investigation. Also apply anti-inflammatory gel like voltarenthanks

input: Hi. I had a housemate who had this grotty blistery thing all over his feet, which I seem to have caught. I had hoped that when he moved out it would have cleared up, which is not the case. Between the toes, and on the side of my foot Ive had several outbreaks, and when the blisters burst it seems to spread. The blisters and sites in general are very itchy. In the last week I had a large one of these blisters develop on the bottom of my foot, and when it burst it has become quite painful and red and seems to be infected. The skin around this area is also very itchy and is painful to walk on. In the last two weeks I have been working in a very dirty workshop, which would include exposure to dust, dirt and chemicals, and since my work boots are old and full of holes it is more than possible that some of this stuff has gotten into my shoes and to the infected site.Now, Im planning on going to the free university doctor on Monday, because as a student I cant afford to go to one of the emergency weekend docs, so I would like to know if there is anything I can do to reduce swelling or fight infection in the meantime.Thanks muchly :)
output: Hi there, As you have rightly concluded, we need to deal with the wound infection first, and deal with the blisters later when your university doctor can have a look at it.  What I would recommend right now is some anti-inflammatory tablets like diclofenac or even ibuprofen to help deal with the swelling and pain on walking.  For the infection itself, if you could get your hands on some antibiotic cream like mupirocin or acidic acid it would be useful to apply it twice a day to help control the infection.  If you are not able to get the antibiotic cream, find yourself some antiseptic cream with chlorhexidine or iodine to just help kill off whatever surface bacteria is there.  Try to clean the wound twice a day with some antiseptic solution to just get rid of any discharge and bacteria that is collecting on the surface.  Keep it as Chat Doctor. Your university doctor would reassess it on Monday and be able to prescribe you oral antibiotics if needed, and further treatment for the blisters itself. Hope this helps.

Can t walk normal anymore. Not sure if I tore or separated a mcl or something. The main problem is that it s not getting any better.

What is your age and are you having any signs of high blood pressure or diabetes?  Kindly get it Physically examined by an orthopedist and do an MRI scan of the knee. The history sounds more of the full ligament tearing. Taking immediate action will be good as if avoided later the knee internal structures which are of course soft tissue will get damaged and land into the early signs of Osteoarthritis of knee and will demand knee replacement. The earlier, the better. Take an MRI and meet up and orthopedist at the earliest for the better outcome of the treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: my son has been having pain in his right side and more into the middle of his abdomen.  He constantly feels like he is going to get sick.  He has missed 9 days of schoo counting today.  he has had a CT scan and an Ultrasound.  BotChatDoctore back fine.  They found enlarged limp nodes in that area.  I have heard many people say that they had the same thing and the results came back with these test that they didnt need their gallbladder out.  then they had a HIDA scan and it showed differently.  Once the  gallbladder was removed, they felt much better.  Help me please. more importanly, how can i help my son?
output: Hi. Thanks for your query and concern for your son. Young boy missing the school due to pain in abdomen on the right more in the middle of abdomen. Constant feeling of sickness. The CT scan and ultrasonography are not normal as there are few enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen at the same site. The gall bladder must be normal and removing the gall bladder without any evidence of inflammation or stone is no reason to remove it for a school going child. The reason for the pain in abdomen is obvious. Get the relevant tests of blood, urine and stool, Tidal for Typhoid, Quantifier gold test for Tuberculosis, Ultrasonography guided FNAC ID the nodes are just bellowed the anterior abdominal wall. Give him a 7-day course of antibiotic, metronidazole, probiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines, review the size of the lymph nodes by ultrasonography. Give additional course of 2 more weeks and see the results. He will be fine by then. If there is no regression even after 3 weeks course, he needs Laparoscopic visualization of the abdomen, biopsy of the lymph nodes and then a definitive treatment as per the reports.

input: My GP has said for some time that I have an auto immune disorder . She doesn t seem to have a solution or name other than fibromyalgia. I have been diagnosed with many inflammatory diseases and am in nearly constant pain from one source or other.

Any medications that have been able to provide relief my now be taking a toll on my liver and causing symptoms of failure according to my Dr. I am unsure what type of specialist I should be looking for to try to find a solution and some relief.

Symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM) are diffuse pain all over the body with some tender points, joint pains, weakness, sleep disturbances and mood disturbances.

input: Hi - i am 41, i had my child at the age of 24, and no children thereafter. we are planning for a child desparately now, but my gyna says my egg quality is poor, one miscarriage happened, one IUI failed, one IVF failed. doctors are saying i should go for donor egg, i am not in favor of this. my DH is health, he is 42, his sperm is perfectly fine. what should we do? SS
output: Hello SST hanks for writing to us with your health query. You should have testing of ovarian reserve. This is tested by measurement of a hormone called AMH (anti Mullein Hormone). It is also measured by AFC (astral follicular count) - counting number of astral follicles on ultrasound on day 2 of your cycle. Also, your capacity to produce good quality eggs can be judged easily by your response to the stimulation injections given for GUI and IVF. If your doctors have opined that your ovarian reserve is poor, you have to accept that. Supplements like DHEA might slightly improve this, but it is not proven conclusively. Yes, the answer for you is egg donation / adoption. Of course, the alternative is following your heart and going for more costly attempts at IVF knowing fully well that the odds are in favor of failure, not success. Hard as it is to arrive to terms with this, the earlier you do, the better. Take care.

input: I have an allergic reaction when ever i go outside in the day light the lights in my house are not bright and i have been toldi have solar graphia how can i get this to go away because i want to be a normal kid again im Only 15 and i cant go to school because of this and i cant honestly do anything its ruineing my life to be honest
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, and thanks for posting your query to the forum. Your solar graphic is actually a problem of photo-dermatitis for which you are getting allergic reaction in sunlight exposure. Our human skin is a multi-layered structure, and it has tendency to wear and tear repeatedly on exposure to environmental factors. In certain situation when the exposure of the environmental factor is too high then the skin has the tendency to get red and itchy. These red areas appear as mild to moderate eruptions on exposed areas of body which are known as POLE. Simply saying sun burns. I would like to suggest you some more of remedies:1) SUN PROTECTION: by sun protection in form of proper covering and clothing. You must wear full sleeves clothes and gloves along with a hat every time you move out in sun. 2) Sunscreens: These do help but not as completely as covering body by clothes. Even then whenever the sunscreen is used-it should be used half an hour before going out as it requires 30 minutes to get activated.3) A LOT OF VITAMIN A and LYCOPENE IN DIET: Vitamin A plays a very important n role in sun protection. It along with certain antioxidants in our diet of fruits helps us best in reducing the damage to sunlight. SO I suggest you to have lot vitamin A and lycopene in diet. You should eat all fruits as well papaya, tomatoes and beat root containing these things in plenty.4) You can also have the antioxidant capsule but follow a good diet as the main part. Your tendency of sun burn will decrease slowly and might take multiple of months to get better form internally, so have patience as well best of measure as suggested above. I hope these information will help you.

input: In early Spring, I had a very hard, dry cough which did not respond to antibiotics. Had every test and scan to eliminate everything, which they did. XRay showed pleural effusions. This has been drained twice but came back. All testing shows fluid to be benign. Doctor changed a prescription I have been taking for years to see if I might have developed an allergy to it. Next XRay is to be 8-18-11. I know the fluid is still there but is not causing trouble. When I am lieing down at night and take a deep breath, it is a little uncomfortable, but not bad, and I am not bothered too much in the day. I am 63 and do not want to have surgery. Hope it won t be necessary. Is it dangerous to live with this condition? Thank you.
output: HelloProbably the pleural liquid might be from heart problems. Discuss with your doctor for this. Regards Chat Doctor.

Now there is a small dry itchy patch on top of my vagina pubic area and dry itchy patches on the nape of my neck. Now its to the point where my arms, thighs, legs, butt, and arm pits itch as well..... how do i stop the itching???
output: HelloThanks for your query. You should consult a dermatologist. Multiple itchy and scaly areas could indicate a skin condition like psoriasis, lichen etc. It could also herald a liver disease. Also, moisturize your skin well, and avoid scratching or touching the areas. Get your blood sugars tested as well. All the best.

input: Five days ago I felt pain under my neck area and noticed several small lumps (next to each other) on my left side of my neck/throat. They re lower down my neck than where my lymph nodes are normally swollen, although I know I ve got lots of them all over. They haven t gone away yet. I noticed that when I swallow I feel something in my throat, I ve been tired recently and that I m always cold. Anything to worry about or just my body fighting off something so my lymph nodes irritated?
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The history suggest multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck region and as you said its chronic cause.2. Lymph nodal enlargement is seen in presence of local infection / inflammation, systemic cause and finally lymph nodal pathology itself.3. For better evaluation - after examination an ultrasound neck would help.4. Ultrasound will help to find out the nature of lumps its source and extensions.5. An FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology to evaluate the cause / cells present.6. After that appropriate treatment can be taken. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

input: I have a four year old who has had low grade temp every other week or so since winter. I dismiss this as cold/viral. She started last week AGAIN with a croupy cough and mild congestion which I treated with OTC meds. Yesterday morning she was sleepy acting and went down for a nap at 10 am after waking around 8 am and slept for 1 1/2 hours. She woke with a temp of 102.5 and has run a steady temp since then even with tylenol. The lowest it has been has been 100.5 although she does not really have other complaints and seems to be achey as she wants to be held then wants to lay on the sofa or bed next to us, wants her back rubbed then asks almost immediately for us to stop. SHOULD I have her seen today?
output: it's better to be checked by her pediatrician, to assess her respiration, croup usually is associated with low grade fever, a complete physical exam will confirm the diagnosis and respiratory status should be checked carefully by the examiner .hope she becomes better soon

output: Hollowed this very carefully and you will get the desired answer for your son. ASTHMA :Airways hyperresponsiveness that is secondary to inflammatory airways' disease that results in recurrent or chronic episodes of WHEEZE, SHORTNESS of BREATH(SOB0, CHEST TIGHTNESS &/or COUGH particularly at night or in the early morning (your son is having all these symptoms including hoarseness of voice, may be due to laryngeal edema (side effect of prednisolone or inflammation of larynx). Pollen, dust (fine dusting powder) mist, molds, pests (cockroaches) , fumes, smoking (active and passive) , sudden chance of temperature (increase or decrease) , as all these are predisposing factors which triggers asthmatic attack. If possible avoid these. When such patient visit my clinic I prescribe Montelukast+albuterol tablet once or twice in day. Dosage are 0.2 mg of / kg body weight of each tablet. Hot coffee and steam inhalation provide instant relief as these acts as bronchodilators. I never prescribe PREDNISOLONE my patient. This is only meant for serious cases.

input: After a nasty attack 18 months ago, I was left with a broken jaw in 3 places. After two ops it was fixed to the best they can with 5 plates. Since then I ve not been able to open my mouth properly, would say there s a gap of 1.5 cm between teeth when fully open. During the last few wks I m suffering constant pain all down the left side of my face, hurts more when I move head up and down. Any ideas...thanks
output: Hello and thank you for your question. You need to have your jaw rebroken clinically and realigned correctly.  Your bite is now off and this is affecting how your jaw moves around the jaw joint.  Surgery would be the best option for you and possible orthodontic intervention to help get your teeth to touch correctly. Best wishes to you. 

input: Hello.For the past 4-5 days, the right side of my stomach has hurt. Its not excruciating pain but it hurts. Made worse when I press on it. I have also had an on and off low grade fever (around 99.5 degrees) and nausea. Also, the right side of my stomach feels harder than the left side.
output: Based on your description, you seem to be suffering from gastritis. If that is the case, you would need to take omeprazole capsule once daily before breakfast for one and a half months. You also need to take small but frequent meals. However, the final diagnosis can be made only after proper examination and I strongly insist that you visit a doctor and get yourself examined. The low grade on and off fever needs to be investigated and is probably unrelated to your abdominal pain. You would need to get it investigated to rule out conditions like tuberculosis which could be a possible cause.

input: Hello Doctor, I am of 29yrs old and a mother of a 3 yr old. My husband is abroad and I am going to stay with him by Jan. We are not planning to have a second one until my kid is atleast 5. So I am looking for an opinion for having an IUD as we are not happy with condoms and scared of the side effects of pills. I consulted a doctor in my place and she says it is difficult for her to insert as the cervix is a bit above than usual and it would be very painful. I have read that this can also be done by giving local anaesthesia. I would like to have a second opinion on this.
output: Hi, With good positioning, there usually is no difficulty in IUD insertion. If I were your doctor, To facilitate the procedure I would ask you to come for IUD insertion just after census. I would advise you to take a tablet of Broken 2 hours before IUD insertion. This would take care of possible discomfort. I would ask you to pass urine just before the procedure and place you in lithotomy position and insert IUD. There is no need for any local cervical anesthesia. The prick of the local anesthesia would cause same discomfort as inserting IUD. Broken is enough to take care of the discomfort. I hope this helps.

output: Hi, Cannot say in your particular case, but generally, the location and movement of a pain gives clues as to what is going on. This pain goes in a pathway up to the neck where the problem is. Without an exam, I can only give general information, and spinal TB is really hard to get rid of and as it spreads it hits areas and that can include nerves, but it can continue on to give spinal meningitis or total paralysis.

input: I have a 3.1cm x 2.2cm x 1.3cm endometrial polyp. Endometrial stripe is measuring 2.2 cm. The polyp has a feeding vessel. I am 46 years old and am not premenopausal according to my blood tests, but I have been suffering from severe anemia for years and iron supplements do not help. I have had every test possible to see if I am bleeding somewhere in my body and this is the only sign of internal bleeding. I have very heavy periods and have excessive brown spotting between periods. Do you think the polyp can be causing my anemia, and if so, would it be necessary to have the polyp removed.
output: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, According to your history, the endometrial polyp is responsible for heavy bleeding and thus anemia. Endometrial polyps which are small are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, in your case the endometrial polyp is large and is causing heavy bleeding and anemia. In such a situation it is advisable to get the polyp removed since it removes the cause of bleeding and thus resolves anemia also. Consult your gynecologist for further work up. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

input: My 11 yr old son was kicked in the crutch a few weeks ago and I have now noticed that his testicles seem to be hanging extremely low (lower than they have ever been before). He says they are not painful at all and there is no discolouration in them at all. Should this be a concern for me or is this normal at 11.
output: Hi...testicles hanging far or near to the body will depend on the ambient temperature changes. If the ambient temperature is hot then the testicles will be hanging far from the abdomen and if the ambient temperature is cool then they will be nearer to the abdomen. As there is no pain or discoloration, I do not think it is related to the injury. Regards -

input: I have had a cough for almost two weeks now. I noticed the chest congestion goes away after lying down and when I wake up it s gone until I have been up for 30 minutes. The congestion starts to come back and about mid day I have been getting sinus pressure and headaches. I have started to notice a tightness in my right jaw as well. Could this be a serious concern? Should I see a dr or is it just bronchitis that will go away soon? I have noticed a slight improvement in the chest congestion but the jaw pain has me worried
output: Hi. I understand your concerns. Cough of 2 weeks is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Get a chest x-ray done, a normal rules out lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Treating sinusitis is also very important as that may be also the cause for cough. You will need a detailed evaluation for the same.

input: hi, i am experiencing stiffening of my fingers, at first i ignored it but i noticed it happens more often now. Most of it at night. And the lid of my right eye is often pulsating, it has been more than a week now. What could be the cause of my concerns?
output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query.First, I would like to reassure you that there is no need to worry about your current symptoms. They are most likely due to over-strain of muscles and fatigue. It would improve with rest. However, if you do not get better in a few more days, then, a brain scan should be done to exclude any ischemia (lack of blood flow to the brain). Also, thyroid profile and vitamin B12 level should be checked. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

input: I recently had my gallbladder removed about 5 weeks ago. I am 24, 100.2 lbs, I have started noticing blood in my stool. First they were loose bloody stool then normal dark bowel movement with blood in the toilet and toilet paper. Could this be due to the surgery? Should I wait it out or call my doctor immediately?
output: Hi, Thanks for posting your query. I am Chat Doctor. K and I am pleased to assist you. There are many causes of blood in stools like hemorrhoids fissures, colitis including IBD and malignancy. Since it occurred after surgery in your case, the first possibility is C diff related colitis probably due to antibiotics in the post-operative period. A stool test and a colonoscopy may be done for evaluation. Get medical attention at the earliest. I hope that answers your question.

input: 1Hi Doctor - I feel heaviness and feeling of swelling in my head. Heaviness is from last 2-3 months and i prevails for 1 week and then goes. Post that it comes again and last again for 1 week. I consulted one doctor and he gave me treatment of 15 days antibiotic and anti allergic for sinus . It helped me and complete month of January i was ok. But this feeling has again returned. I have observed mild heaviness/swelling in palms and feet too. I am having sound sleep and dont have nausea . I would like to get this evaluated but bit afraid from any side of neuro disorder.
output: Hello vishalvi2008Thanks for asking question, welcome to ChatDoctorThe swelling or heaviness in head which responded to the antibiotic therapy and again recurred, so there is very high chances of CHRONIC sinusitis of frontal sinus, as it is usually present with light headache and heaviness. Second option we can think is any neurological lesion but usually swelling on hands along with feeling of swelling on head are not features. If you are in doubt and stressed best is to get MR scan done, secondly visit a good doctor for proper treatment of chronic sinusitis as you have to take antibiotics, antihistamines for long. MR scan will also show the sinusitis.Thanks, Hope, I cleared your doubt.

output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. So, your father is having relapse of tb with fungal infection and complicated by pneumothorax (air in lungs). Honestly speaking, this is not a good sign for prognosis. Pneumothorax in Tb and fungal pneumonia is having poor prognosis. Healing takes very long time in case of active lung infection. So first give him anti-tubercular and antifungal Chat Doctor.  He shouldn't keep the tube for at least 1-2 months. If still not improving after 1-2 months, get done thoracoscopic intervention for pneumothorax. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks.

input: I am 48 year old female, in optimal health. I am very active. I do not drink alcohol or smoke (quit both over 15 years ago). Other than a little tennis elbow I have few complaints. My diet consists of vegetables, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, nuts and seeds, low-carb pastas and tortillas made from whole grains, lots of water, 1 cup of coffee and 3 diet sodas a day. I don t eat fast food or junk. I also take a daily multi-vitamin supplement and Aleve twice a day for my tennis elbow. I occasionally enjoy an Atkins nutritional bar (I like that they have no added sugar). I have normally fairly dry skin, I am a redhead with freckles and fair skin (Irish). Just about an hour ago I noticed a cluster of tiny scabs high on my right arm near my shoulder (about where someone would pat you on the arm for a greeting). I don t recall that area feeling particularly itchy recently, or noticing a disturbance in the skin before this. It was a little itchy, which is what led me to the discovery. As soon as I scratched the area, the tiny scabs came off under my fingernails. The skin bled a little. I put hydrogen peroxide on the area and then triple antibiotic ointment. There are about 20 tiny little pink blemishes now (similar to pin-pricks). No bleeding (except for initially) and the area is not itchy, hot, reddened or swollen. Do you have any idea as to what could have caused this? Is there anything else I should look out for?
output: It can be a kind of skin infection most probably (on you query presentation)herpes simplex but for proper evaluation and treatment you need to show it to a dermatologist where in he will prescribe you ointments and medicine hope you find this useful of you need any help can revert

input: my son is 5 months old and weighs 8.1 kg.for last 6 days he was down with col,cough n fever..yesterday he was doing good but thn again today his temprature has gone up to 100.4 and now he is on medication..18th is the date for the final dose of rotavirus and pnuemooccal..is it possible?
output: Welcome to the ChatDoctorI completely understand your concerns but don't worry. Every rise in temperature of your children body doesn't need a course of antibiotics. Occasional fever episodes such as 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit may be due to developing immunity in his body against mild viral infections which are quite common in this age. You need to get worried about this if:1. It's associated with decreased acceptance of feeds, lethargy, excessive sleepiness or irritability.2. If other associated symptoms such as loose stools, vomiting, breathing problems, crying on micturition etc. are present. If he is feeding well, active, alert and playful, then don't worry. You may definitely go for rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines as per schedule. Fever is not at all a contraindication for routine immunizations. Hopefully this will help you. For further questions, you may contact retake care

input: My dentist told me a few months ago that there seems to be a possible abscess with my lower molar. I don t have insurance so we were going to watch it since there wasn t any associated pain. A couple of days ago I had some pain in my lower jaw so I m going into the dentist to do a follow up xray next week. The pain is gone but tonight I noticed bruising on my neck towards the front below the area on my jaw where the pain was. The bruise is about 3 inches long about 1/2 inche wide, not solid more like a bite mark, it looks like a hicky. Is it something that can wait until morning for my dentist to check?? Thank you, Joy
output: Hi whereas per your symptoms it seems to my belief you are mingling two different problems, must be a chance you have abscess right down under your question tooth which will require a ROOT CANAL TREATMENT.your other problem which is a mark kind could be some insect bite or allergy, but for exact diagnosis could only be made with physical examination to rule out the possibility causing the discoloration of the skin. See a dentist soon, delay your appointment until you can bear the pain. Start with warm saline (half cup Luke warm water+ half tbs salt)rinses at night, it helps in Chat Doctor. Thanxregards

input: Hello, I am a 36 year old woman, 5ft 3 and about 9 1/2 stone.  Over the past few years I have been trying to conceive with my husband with no result.  We have recently just started our first cycle of superovulation and I just had a question to ask.  During superovulation can your body naturally ovulate without having the hgc injection.  Its just i was due to take the injection and i felt some pains as though i was starting to ovulate.  I have now taken the injection and i am still feeling the pains.  Does this mean i might be ovulating now (at my normal time) and not 36 hours or so after the injection was taken.  Its just that i want to get the timing right and as it is a bank holiday weekend i am not able to ask my clinic for a couple of days.  If this is the case and i am ovulating now, how long do i have in order to fertilise the egg.  Thank you
output: IIN many cases of ovulation induction we don't even prescribe Chat Doctor injection as most women ovulate even without it. The reason the injection is prescribed is to make sure that you ovulate. So it is very much possible that you ovulated before the injection. It is generally said after ovulation the egg remains fertile for 24 hrs. Let me know if you have any other queries. Thanks

input: Hi-- I have a question. I have Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy and have had many operations on my legs and also heal-cord lenthening. From the surgery, their is a scar on the back of my calf. One random day it got swollen, not sure why or how. Their was pain at the beginning and now their is no pain at all. It has been a few months that my ankle has been swollen and it still is. Is it common for people with Cerebral Palsy to have this issue. What is going on?
output: Hello, In my opinion, the problem may arise from blood circulation in your calf. An ultrasound of your calf is necessary to evaluate correctly this possibility. Discuss with your Doctor for these issues. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

input: I have a broken tooth second to last molar(wisdom teeth have not came in they are sideways and need to be extracted). I went to a dentist and they used tools that I assumed were sanitized but after they cleaned the area above my broken off tooth I developed a very hard abcess, this was 2 weeks ago and now it formed a head so I popped it to relieve it until I see them the 28th and jellied blood and pus came out, it feels better now but the swelling has made my cheek look puffy and noticeably swollen. Should I take this to the emergency room or wait to see my dentist again?
output: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your query abscess over a broken tooth is due to deep infection in the tooth that is leading to pus formation below the root tips of the tooth. At times infection perforates the bone and the pus gets accumulated in soft tissues leading to lump formation over the gums and swelling of cheek. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and not emergency room and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like x-ray has to be done. You can be advised Root Canal treatment of tooth followed by a course of antibiotics and painkillers if tooth is in condition to be saved. In case of gross damage to tooth extraction is advised. As of now do warm saline gargles bit do not delay the treatment to prevent spread of infection and further complications. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

I don t knom what to do.
output: Hi, Consult an orthopedic and get an X-ray to rule out the fracture. Apply ice packs, and you can take analgesics/anti-inflammatory combination like Diclofenac/Serratiopeptidase combination also. Most probably it will settle by three to four days. You might require a finger immobilizer also. Your orthopedic can help you further. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

input: Hey ..well I am 2 months pregnant and when I urinate I see blood and I get worried I have other children 4 to be exact and my youngest is about to be 7 I didn t experience no problems like this with my others I m just concerned and confused could you help me out?
output: Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Firstly, I would like to suggest that you confirm where from this blood is coming, from the urethra or from the vagina. If it is from the urethra and if this is a fresh bleeding, it is likely to be from the urethral lining, mostly due to some infection. This needs to be treated as it can lead to a miscarriage if left untreated. If the blood is coming out of the vagina, you should inform your health care provider immediately, take absolute bed rest and avoid all strenuous activity. A sonogram should be taken to note the state of the pregnancy. Further management is accordingly planned. Hope this helps.

input: hi, I was bitten by an unknown insect almost two weeks ago and the inflammation of the bite is still there along with tissue bruising, leaving my skin around the bite discoloured. I have noticed over the past few days after the bite hole if you wish, has raised into a almost puss like spot, however around the skin is still discoloured, inflamed and sore burst and left my skin slightly torn. I have this continuous tingling sensation which gradually increases in pain, almost like a really bad case of pins and needles. the pain starts from the bite down to the sole of my feet. I have no idea what to do about it, and how to treat it. all I have dine thus far is take ibuprofen for the pain and apply an ice pack and on occasion Vaseline around the bite. however nothing seems to be working.
output: Welcome to Chat Doctor. I went through the history you have provided here. It seems from the history that you are having irritation of skin following an insect bite. These symptoms indicate secondary infection in the skin. I usually treat these conditions by the use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.

input: over the last two weeks on three separate occasions i have felt as though my heart is being gently squeezed, a bit like a contraction, i can only describe the intensity as like a wave, starting very gently reaching a peak and then tapering off.  i am not in any pain but it is a very odd feeling
output: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having simple muscular spasm but better to rule out any heart diseases first. So get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Simple muscle spasm is more likely in your case. So avoid bad postures in sleep. You can apply warm water pad on affected areas to avoid such contractions. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

input: Hi i have been under a lot of stress , i was un headaces the back of my, i was diagnosed with herpes a yr ago whilei broke out with a rash and ended up with a boil that im taking antibiotics for, i have been sort of weak and a Lil lightheaded but much better than i was, today ifound what seems to me to be inflammation inbetween my shoulders and seems to be the reason for the funny feeling in my head, but the aches have left, no fever was present in any of this what do u think.
output: Hello, Firstly, I think you should get treated for your stress. Herpes is a stress-prone condition that keeps on coming until you improve your general condition. Having the disease and taking antibiotics for long makes you feel weak and that can add to your stress. Try to improve your general health and see a doctor. Wish you speedy recovery.

I lift weights 3 times a week and feel good. I am a non smoker and non drinker. But I do have 3 to 4 diet cokes a day. No coffee. On my annual physicals, my ekg has always been great. An athlete s heart. My bottom number has always been in the upper 80 s however.
output: Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that these blood pressure values are high, but a single high blood pressure value is not an indicator or chronic arterial hypertension.  It could be related to psychological stress or physical activity.  For this reason, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values frequently during the day, in the next days, in sitting position, after 10 minutes of total relax. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (125/85 mmHg), I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests to investigate the possible underlying causes: - a chest X-ray study-complete blood count, PCR, ESR - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes- fasting glucose-kidney and liver function tests-cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels for possible a Chat Doctor.

Recently my lab work showed very elevated liver enzymes so i had to see a specialist who  found salmonella in my system.  Could the original diagnose of mono had been incorrect and all along i had salmonella?
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. Yes, it is possible, but mono is more likely since there was throat infection associated with elevated LFT. Salmonella rarely cause LFT elevation unless there was blood poisoning. So I suggest doing blood tests to verify is it mono. This is routine test today. After you establish right diagnosis, the treatment can be started. Wish you good health. Regards.

Based o the facts that to have posted it seems that you have been indulged in masturbation since 3 years and now facing health problems like general weakness, muscle pain and loss of ability to concentrate etc. which you think these problems to be due to habitual masturbation.

All the problems that you are facing now are mind related and due to anxiety. Following measure will help you to boost up your confidence and improve your heath. 1) Practice regular exercise for 45 minutes followed by meditation for 1/2 an hour in the morning. 2) Take high protein diet rich in vegetables and fruits and vitamin A, C,D, E.and Zinc 3)Take anti oxidants like Almonds 5-6 everyday4) Avoid alcohol and smoking.

But not getting rid off it permanently. Please help me.

input: I want children.. I have none, I ve suffered a stillborn and one miscarriage. Ever since my still born, my menstrual cramps are severe to the point I m crying in pain then exhausted falling asleep also, the pain is only on my right side. My gyno for my miscarriage did not take into consideration my questions and worries. They said my ultra sound looked healthy. I m trying to get pregnant still new at it but have no idea if there is something wrong I just need advice, even what to ask my gyno next time.
output: Hello, I can understand your concern. First let me ask you some questions are you consciously married? How was your ultrasound of your stillborn (how many months baby) did it show any abnormalities?. It's better for you to go for genetic counselling. That might help you to detect any chromosomal abnormalities. It can be done by a blood test of you and your husband. If its normal then no need to worry otherwise try to avoid travel. Eat healthy stay healthy and also do a blood test to rule out viral infection.

input: i had unprotected sex twice yesterday with my boyfriend about 30-45 minutes after each other, but he finish in me and im on birth control but lately i havent really had a chance to take it around the same time at night & I ve missed a night taking it, im wondering if i should take plan b
output: Hello misunderstand your concernAccording to your history you missed one pill. But if It is just 24 hours after missing pill then take two tablets simultaneously means missed tablet and that day tablet together.  So take birth pills together that prevent the pregnancy but take the remaining tablet regularly. So in this case no need of Play B pill. But if 24 hours has been crossed, and you did not take missed pill then you have to take plan B as early as possible or with in 72 hours after sex to prevent the pregnancy. Hope this will help you Best regards

input: My 10 yr old daughter has started experiencing light headedness, dizziness, and shaking when playing or practicing sports. While playing soccer she breaths very heavy then hits a wall about 15 min into the game. Recently she has taken up ppitching for softball and during her lessons she sees spots, bright lights, feels like she will pass out, and becomes nausious. Our Dr thought it might be exercise induced asthma but even with the inhaler she still has these issues. Could there be something else I should have her tested for?
output: DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your details. Your doctor, before coming to his conclusion, that the problem could be exercise induced asthma, must have gone through ritualistic physical and pathological investigations. In that case, if the investigations are done, the problem could be anxiety and obsession. Anxiety could also cause such symptoms, but there will not be any organic reasons. Your 10-year young girl is learning life and at this age, they learn diseases too. At such an age, obsessing with health problems are also common. She could need health related psychological counseling. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible. Hope this answers your query.  Further clarifications are welcome. Good luck. Take care.

input: If a 15 yr old looses his C5 Vertibrae in a diving accident and it is replaced by a bone from his foot - what are the likely short and long term reprocussions of this.  He also has not a broken spine but a compressed and swollen spine from the accident that happened 3 weeks ago.  He has been paralyized but has regained feeling in his toes, feet, knees, can feel urinating, passing stool and farting, can feel his shoulder and move one hand and his eyes.
output: The foot should do just fine post replacement. But he obviously has some level of spinal cord injury. His ultimate functional level will likely be determined by where he is at functionally/neurologically at about the 12-week mark. So, he should be a part of a good Spinal Cord Rehabilitation program to maximize his recovery.

input: my boyfriend has been complaining of pain in his abdomen along with this pain is tenderness, this is located on his left side. he also has been experiencing some heart burn in the morning along with coughing. he states the pain is always there it just is not a severe at times
output: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If Is were his doctor, after a personal physical examination of his abdomen, I would have advised for an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out any intro abdominal organ pathology. I would also advise him not to eat from outside if he does as intestinal infections might creep in through outside food. Some routine tests like stool for ova and cyst, urine routine/microscopic and blood test (CBC) might also aid in making the diagnosis. Till then, he might go for some anti-spasmodic Chat Doctor.  Further management would depend on reports of the investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

input: My son who has mental health problem  virtually behaves normally outwardly.Sometimes ago he used to urinate into a bottle and throw it outside.Now he believes that his bed and mattress are not good  though we bought a new solid bed and mattress only about a year old.He eats strangely mostly vegetables and plenty of  chicken breast with no fat perhaps up to 15 a day.Recently started eating so much banana -up to 2 to 3 bunches up to 15-20 a day. He dances almost all night and sleeps thereafter till past midday. Refuses to sleep on his bed despite buying new mattress for himself few days ago.He is 25.In the past had insisted there was a problem with his jaw when there was nothing wrong,spent so much money seeing all sorts of practitioners.His bizarre behaviour is baffling  and puts us under severe stress especially as he has refused to take full dose of medication prescribed and only cuts it and takes about a tenth
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor He is showing abnormal behavior like refusing to sleep on mattress, urinating in bottom then throwing out, eating strangely, refusing to accept the problem and not visiting a doctor. All these problems can occur normally also, but they are causing significant distress so need further evaluation by a Psychiatrist. He might be having abnormal beliefs or delusional ideas that something is wrong. Due to some psychological change he might be showing such abnormal and bizarre symptoms. Other possibility is some mood disorder or more specifically bipolar. He is showing symptoms like dancing all night, refusing to advise of parents etc. These symptoms could raise possibility of some mood disorder. I would advise you to take him to a Psychiatrist for evaluation of symptoms and to make proper diagnosis. Medicines like antipsychotic Chat Doctor. Thanks hope this helps you

input: A parent just shared that her almost-adult son has displayed voluntary encopresis.  There are sometimes remains left in the bathtub.  This young man has also begun stealing from people and he describes that it is like an addiction, where he wakes up thinking about stealing.  His parents are divorced, he lives with Dad and Step-mother who constantly criticizes him.  He was an outstanding baseball player, but began stealing from teammates.  He is defiant at home, his grades are falling, hes lost interest in the things he used to do, such as baseball.  The adults dont forgive him and theyve stripped him of a phone, a bedroom door, etc. and have given him no way to earn things back.  This young man says hes not suicidal; hes using pot.  This is such a mental disorder and I dont want to do more harm to him as a school counselor.  What type of therapy do you suggest?  How do I get the parents to understand this behavior is very much about them?
output: HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor I think, he has conduct disorder or cannabis induced psychosis and in that case, he needs proper mental evaluation by psychiatrist. If he has conduct disorder, then he needs behavioral therapy. Being a counselor, you can try positive and negative reinforcement in his case. That would help to modify his behavior. In case of psychosis, he would improve with antipsychotic Chat Doctor.  Better to tell them to consult a psychiatrist. In case, you need further help, you can ask. Thanks

input: Iv recently had major back surgery and was taking paracetamol for a long period thought it was better than codeine based tablets due to co sit patios etc ...just had liver function test and my results come back not good.. My gap said may have been anaesthetic still in my system had only been 3 weeks when I had tests done but could this also be due to paracetamol ?
output: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. This is more likely due to paracetamol than to anesthesia. You should stop taking it and repeat LFT in a month. If this is still raised you should do liver ultrasounds and check viral markers because there can be some liver disorder. Till that, avoid alcohol and follow some hepatoprotective diet. Wish you good health.

input: HiI have a small lump on my inner upper arm about 1 inch from my inner elbow. The lump is slightly sensitive to touch and I only noticed it a few days ago. There is no bruising in the area to suggest a knock. The lump does move as I can move it with my fingers. Hopefully nothing and just after a bit of advice on whether or not I should see a doctor.Many thanks in advance for your helpSteven
output: Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a cyst (a sebaceous or a gelatinous type), a fibrous or a lipoma. These lesions can occur anywhere in the body and have the tendency to recur.  Management (medical and surgical if indications are found and the lesion is bothersome for you already) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

input: Hi, I had my wisdom teeth taken out about a week and a half ago and had no problems what so ever with them. In fact I was off pain medicine on the third day and only had minor swelling to show what had happened. About half an hour I was brushing my teeth and this piece of clear-white tissue came out along with some dark brown streaks on it. It came out of the lower gum socket that has been catching food a lot. Early it had been bothering me and I cleaned it out, but it still felt like there was something in there. So Im wondering if that was in fact part of the important healing process or a piece of food? And if it was important is there any chance that I still might get a dry socket or have it get infected? Sorry about this being so long. Thank you so much!! ~Ana

output: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First, I would like to reassure you that your symptoms do not suggest anything serious, as your CT scan of the brain is normal. Only very small tumors may get missed on CT scan, which can be picked up on MRI brain. Lorazepam is a Chat Doctor.  There is no need to worry at present.

input: I am 67 years old, measuring 173 cm and weighing 85kg. After the death of my wife 6 months ago, I got a medium level depression (which I am treating with a daily intake of 1mg vitamin B12). I went to Morocco for work to change my mind. After about 6 weeks I got the flu there. Two brilliant local doctors confirmed to me that I had to take immediately an antibiotic because I supposedly had a pneumonia. I did it and promptly lost about 12kg in about one week, for lack of food intake possibility due to a totally blocked colon and suddenly strong stomach cramps and breathing problems. I returned quickly to Sweden where the emergency Dr. detected immediately asthma generated by a virus. I have managed to get completely rid of the asthma in the lungs since then.Now for the last 6 weeks about, my nose suffers from a strange problem. The problem started with a very strong liquid (non salty tasting) mucus discharge, followed by a total nose blockade. I tried Otrivin and similar products and Claritine with almost no effect.When coming home my nose is usually ok for the first 30 minutes. Afterwards the nose starts plugging until a total block of both nostrils. No mucus is running. When I take the car to go to the nearest shopping mall, my two nostrils open up again slowly over a period of about 30 minutes and become totally normal again in the mall. Returning home, my problem starts again.What is my problem? I am thinking of a birch wood allergy, since 70% of my furniture is made of birch.
output: Hello, thanks for your query, pneumonia not treated properly can show as a respiratory difficulty. Even allergic rhinitis(sneezes, running nose, nasal blocks) untreated can go for allergic asthma. Kindly visit an ENT surgeon for further evaluation(allergic polyp) and treatment. All the best. Take care.

output: Greetings. Inability to control emotions allow a male to get too excited during sleep which causes nightfall & making the organ small which is a normal phenomenon until & otherwise its within the normal physiological limit of an individual. Most of the people have many wrong ideas about nightfall - that it causes ill effects on health like nervous weakness, reduced energy, etc. or sexual problems like impotence in the future all of which is NOT true and these are just myths and misconceptions provided they are within certain limit. For too much stress, i advice you to do activities(Play outdoor games you like / Read books/ get along with friends / meet your relatives/ etc., ) that relaxes mind keeping you fresh.

input: I was in an auto accident three weeks ago and had a 10 inch black and purple bruise on my right breast and collar bone are with hard lumps underneath.  The bruising is gone and the hard lumps are slowly going away.  However, I am now having pain and burning in my collar bone.  It seems to be getting worse.  Im wondering if it is a bruise.  Thank you.
output: Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. It is good that the bruising is gone. The pain and the burning in the collar bone area may be due to either there is a hairline fracture for which you have to get X-ray of the area with a pointer kept on the spot of pain. Another possibility is the sensory nerves are getting entrapped into the scar tissue and giving you a typical burning sensation. This would go away on its own. IF severe, request your Doctor to give medicines for the same.

output: Hi there,Bleeding or spotting in early pregnancy, may mean a threatened abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. Both these conditions require continuous monitoring and treatment, which is why they are asking you to go back to the hospital for further evaluation. Repeated blood tests and ultrasound are required to know the location and normalcy of the pregnancy. If it is a threatened abortion, there is a high chance of the pregnancy continuing normally, but the first 12 weeks will be difficult. In case of ectopic pregnancy either medical or surgical treatment is definitely required. If your wife is having dizziness then it should not be ignored, and you need to see the doctor as advised. Hope this helps. Regards.

If it is coming again and again without external cause then it should be investigated, Especially if blood pressure is high then pheochromocytoma can cause.

input: My grandmother had 11 children but one after the other were dying within months of their birth. It was only my aunt who had survived. My father was born (number 12th child in the house). At his birth the midwife advised my grandparents that -the milk of my grandmother might be poisonous for baby and my grandparents sought help from friends to find a mother who can breastfeed their son (my father). a mother from other faith was found and she nursed my father like her own son. My father and grandparents are all gone but during funeral of my sister in January, 2011, my cousin (the eldest son of my late aunt) mentioned this in one of the family gatherings. We all know about this but since it came back down the memory lane, I was wondering to know, what could have been the cause for those deaths? Can mother milk be poisonous? Also, I would now like to visit Pakistan, the ancestral town of my parents/grandparents/greatgrandparents.. to find the family that helped our grandparents. We are Hindus and had to leave Pakistan at the time of partition in 1947, and the lady that breastfed my father was a muslim. Both aspects are important to me now. Regards

I have been off food, with a constant sick feeling, but terribly thirsty.
output: Hello, Implanon is quite effective against unwanted pregnancy and its failure rate near about 0.1%. Here, you need to undergo one TVS scan to exclude possible miscarriage. Other reasons are side effect of implant, hormonal imbalance, unnoticed uterine polyp/ fibroid, adenomyosis, DUB, pelvic infection etc. Following initial test, you need to consult with gynecologist for next investigation and suggestive medication. You may need to use other contraceptive method if implant causes that. Maintain genital hygiene. Take healthy diet with iron supplements. Be well.

output: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Usually Escitalopram and clonazepam does not have effect of menses or blood coagulation factors. So you should consult your gynecologist for detailed evaluation and examination. Doctor may advise you to go for blood tests including hologram, bleeding time, clotting time and ultrasound. Treatment would be directed as per cause. You may need iron supplement if your hemoglobin level is low. I hope It will help. Thanks.

output: Hi, Thankyou for query. Brief answer.get a swab test done first. Detailed answer... Since ring worm can occur using infected towels or sharing clothes with infected person. But as your baby is also discharging, so get a swab test done to differentiate between chlamydia or fungal infection and treat accordingly. For ring worm you may apply statin powder and cortisone cream 2 times a day daily for few days and follow accordingly. Hopefully my answer is helpful. Chat Doctor.

input: I fell yesterday landing on the left outer area of my left shin.  I have arthritis in that knee but more towards the inside of the knee.  My skin felt like it had road rash, but the skin didnt break is just rough (I had on jeans, so thats probably why).  Now it is numb.  Should I be concerned and get this checked out, or is this normal?
output: Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  In my opinion, i don't won't you to be worried and for many patients I suggest icing it for the first 48 hours, NSAIDs painkiller like Advil when needed, massaging it with topical gels, elevation your left leg on a pillow and avoid bending will be effective for such cases. For the numbness actually its quiet rare but happens when trauma or the swelling affect the nerve supplying this area which will subside when swelling decreases. Otherwise, I recommend X-rays to exclude minor fissures or fracture on your shin-bone. Please click THANK YOU and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful.

Pus cells - 3-4/HP This means that there are inflammatory cells in your urine. If you are feeling urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and pain on urination you might UTI and you might need to take antibiotics (e.g. clotrimazole, ciprofloxacin) after consultation with your physician or urologist

output: Hi, It could be a hematoma. Sometimes, hematomas can grow in size during resorption and may pain also. Change in color is due to clearing of blood products. All you need is some painkillers. If you see further increase in size and pain, consult a surgeon. Hope this helped.

input: I ve had headaches for 31 yrs, they have gradually become more frequent, so that in the last 5 yrs or so I have at least one every two days (more troublesome in the winter than summer). Headache pain is no longer confined to the right or left hemisphere, now it can be most anywhere in the head. Pain is fairly mild when the HA starts, taking 4 - 6 hrs to most painful, and lasts 12 - 16 hrs (sometimes 30+ hrs). Only 2 - 4% of the headaches are as painful as they were in the early yrs. I m experiencing pressure (tightness) mostly in my neck and head accompanied by heavy (hard) heart-beat occurring in the the most painful part of the headache. The pressure (tightness) is a dead ringer for that experienced when taking Imitrex . With the last few headaches I can feel and hear the heart beat plainly and notice it is skipping a beat (4 beats then a miss). I have low blood pressure (100 over 70), pulse 58 to low 60 s. I have seen all kinds of doctors. I ve tried just about everything but acupuncture and botox. Began taking allergy shots 2 mos ago, hoping that may be the cause as I did have HA and vomiting as a kid and took shots which greatly relieved that problem. Oh yes I m 69 yrs old.
output: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for calling Chat Doctor. Forum.  As you describe the headache you are facing must be due to mental tensions, anxiety, or may be due to sinusitis.  I advise you to consult a neurologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have M.R.I. besides other routine tests for confirmation.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.  Best regards.

output: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read carefully your question and understand your concern. It is normal to have some ectopic beats and tachycardia during physical activity and anxiety. But a cardiac arrhythmia can not be ruled out, based only on your symptomatology. I recommend consulting with the GP for a physical examination, a resting ECG and some tests like: a routine blood test, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood sugar and blood electrolytes, to exclude other causes of cardiac arrhythmia. An ambulatory 24-hour ECG monitoring may be necessary to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes,

However her pain increases with the swelling in the left leg whenever she walls even for short distance few steps only. Please advice
output: Hi, Thanks for your query. Repeated joint pains can be due to multiple causes at this age the commonest being poly arthralgia. Other causes can be rheumatoid arthritis, gout, inflammatory diseases like SHE, bursitis, fibromyalgia, etc. For proper diagnosis, some blood tests are advisable like- 1. Serum calcium levels.2. Serum Uric acid levels.3. RA factor4. ESR and CRP5. Serum Creatinine6. X-ray of affected joints. You need a thorough clinical examination followed by investigations under the guidance of an orthopedic. Till then for symptomatic relief, you can take over the counter analgesics, do hot fomentation and apply local analgesic gel on the affected areas. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

input: I was suspected to have Jaundice. The tests of bilirubin showed 3.4 (conj. 0.9 & unconj. 2.5) and 2.2 (conj. 0.8 and unconj. 1.4) and SGPT as 36 and 34. The test for HBsAg was negative (using ELISA method). The ultrasonography of the whole abdomen revealed that only the size of the liver is 139 mm (co-axial length) and spleen is 136 mm (co-axial length), while the rest are fine. The test for Liver Function revealed that everything was fine except the Bilirubin level shows 5.7 (conj. 0.9 & unconj. 4.8) and SGPT as 36. I do not have any vomiting tendency nor do I feel weak. I have a sound sleep, my urine colour is not yellowish, but my eye ball is having some yellowish colour. Sometimes there is formation of gas in the stomach and the stool is not upto the mark. I drink a lot of water (around 4 & 1/2 ltrs.) daily. The doctor has said that this is a harmless jaundice and is due to some enzyme deficiency which is by birth. He also has suggested to lead a normal life and said there is nothing to worry. Now may I please be suggested that if this has really nothing to worry or if there is any medication available to rectify the problem. Looking forward for your valuable reply.

If in case of loose plate some adhesives are available for its retention. So contact your dentist for correct treatment.

input: Doc does a male yeast infection cause annoying tingling and small flesh colored bumps on the penis?Reason I ask is because i had unprotected sex with a mutual friend and have had tingling and irritation a few days after. Its been about 12 days for the tingling but I have yet to see only small bumps that may or may not be herpes.So im curious to as if I have a yeast infection or herpes.I went to 2 different doctors and they said they could not see any herpes. The second doctor gave me a yeast infection cream to apply and the tingling has gone down tremendously but even after 3 days of applying there still is a hint of tingling and redness.
output: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The history and symptoms are suggesting that you are having fungal infection rather than a viral infection like herpes, because in herpes infection there will be painful blisters, and it will subside by itself. As you are having intense itching it may be a fungal infection, but it should be confirmed by physical examination. As you are applying antifungal cream over the lesions and symptoms have come down. I would suggest you to continue this treatment for another one week, by this time it will come down.  If it is not coming down you can try systemic antifungal agents. Thank you.

input: I had blood in my urine for 5 days and then suddenly stopped. I have no pain or fever and the blood was bright red and came at the end of my stream. Now that it has stopped should I still go see a doctor, or was it probably a kidney stone? I am a 38 year old female and had cervical cancer 9 years ago that resulted in a total hysterectomy, other than that I have no other health issues.
output: Hi and thanks for the query, blood in the urine in the absence of lower urinary tract symptoms like pain on urination, frequent urination or difficulties in holding urine often lead first to the suspicion of a bladder tumor. A urine cytology and urological examination and advice is usually needed in this situation. However, possibilities of urinary tract infections must always be ruled out by carrying out routine urine cultures and anti-biotic sensitivity test. Exposures to paints in the past is an important risk factor to be considered. A past history of having spent time in water logged zone, which could be endemic to Schistosomiasis (S. Histologic) could a possibility to bear in mind too. Consulting with a urologist could be very necessary. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.

input: Hi. Im am 16 years of age and yesterday I Noticed a Somewhat medium sized( about the size or a quarter or Slightly bigger) bump on my head Close to my ear. It Is Hard and the area around it is Painful.Im Not Not sure What it is. Can someone help? Could it be A tumor?
output: Hi, Thanks for writing in. A bump on your head for a while, that is hard and firm might be a cyst arising from your scalp. It may or may not be arising from the skull. If it has been present for a long time and is slowly growing, then it must be a benign lesion. In benign firm lesion, they can be Osceola, epidermis cyst or Desmond cyst. I would suggest you to consult a neurosurgeon and get a CT scan done if necessary. Most likely it is not a brain tumor and CT scan will tell if it needs to be removed. Hope this helps.

My appetite has changed I no longer enjoy the food I used to like. I am also taking ferous sulphate. I had a pap smear and candida was detected and treated. What could I suffering from
output: Hello mam!  Intra uterine devices are notorious for the kind of symptoms you mentioned. Loss of appetite can be multidimensional. Your abdominal and lower back pain points towards pelvic inflammatory disease. Add folic acids with A to zinc vitamins with ferrous sulfate. This will help your appetite. Other reason for appetite loss can be the routine or stress. You need to have regular 8 hours sleep use some sleeping aids for short duration if necessary.tireless and fatigue and headaches are also because of loss of appetite and PID.try some antispasmodics for the pain and simple acetaminophen for the headaches. And if the symptoms persist you can always remove your IUD and use some alternate contraception. Remember IUD is a foreign agent to the body and any foreigner is never welcomed. It adds to the adhesions, reduces the fertility rates. Increases the chances of ectopic pregnancies, Ashermans syn Chat Doctor. So you need to try coping up or give up and start an alternative way to contractive. Cheers

output: Hi, I do understand your distress regarding your symptoms. Losing your best friend can be a very traumatic experience. The symptoms that you have mentioned is suggestive of stress leading to depression. I would advise that you talk to your parents regarding your problems and seek a psychiatric consultation.

input: I am 14 weeks pregnant. Every time I go to the dr my BP is high (usually 128/90). They said its because Im getting nervous there. When I take my BP at home, its running about 123/82. When I lay on my left side it goes down to 116/75. Now when I get up in the morning and take it, I am on my left side and it runs about 110/69. Should I worry or are my nerves getting to me.
output: Hello, This much variation is a normal thing. No need to worry about it. Hospital readings are usually higher because of nervousness And also due to activities like walking etc. prior to measurement. So I think no need to worry especially if there are no symptoms like dizziness, blackouts. Hope this helps you.

Over time, the pain has become more acute annd now it takes some time after the cessation of activity for the pain to subside.

input: 2 weeks ago I had loop diathermy treatment after detecting advanced stage 3 pre cancerous cells on my cervix from smears and biopsys.  the treatment appeared to be successful but 10hours later I was rushed to hospital with a haemorrhage and had to be taken in for emergency treatment to stop the bleeding.Originally I had been advised not to have sex for 6 weeks, and to take precautions for up to 3 months after that due to the negative impact sperm has on the repairal of the cervix.I have 3 questions:1. Is it safe for me and my partner to perform foreplay externally?2. When can i begin exercise again?3.When will it be safe to have sex now that I have had a cervical haemorrgage?Hope someone can help x thanks
output: Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about what happened to you.1. Yes, it is very, very safe for you to have foreplay with your partner. Nothing contradicts this.2. You can start to exercise as soon as possible. There is no reason to fear. The greatest fear is with any possible act that can traumatize the cervix and nothing else. If it doesn't involve the vagina, you are safe.3. I will like you to follow up with your doctor. After examining your cervix, he would be able to tell whether the healing has reached levels that can allow you to have sex. Talk the ORGAN who carried out the procedure for follow-up review and recommendations after exams. I hope you find this helpful and it ad Chat Doctor.  Thank you so much for using our services and feel free to ask for more information and clarifications if need be. I wish you the best of health.

input: Hi doctor,I am age 30 years I have been taking Ipill for 1 year like 2 times a week to avoid pregnancy.I missed in july and got pregnant I did not want a baby so used unwanted kit. I and my husband are trying since 3 months to get pregnant but its not happening.Please suggest do I need to visit a gynacaelogist for help?Is it due to usage of Ipill for 1 year I will never get Pregant?Please help
output: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concerns. Please be reassured that Pill does not affect your fertility. It may only cause temporary irregularity in menstrual cycles. It would have been nice if you had provided me some more information like age, BMI, regularity of cycles etc. Since you were pregnant once, you do not seem to have any apparent fertility problems. Relax.  You will conceive again. Among couples trying for baby, 80% conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be stressed. Consult Gynecologist if you do not conceive in a years time. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. I hope this is helpful. If you have any further concerns do contact me through Chat Doctor.

output: Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to next. Decorate can be the cause of this tremor. This is a common complication of this Chat Doctor.

If these tests result normal, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of stopping Decorate ER. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best wishes,

input: I am a 68 year old male in relatively good shape, non-smoker and non-drinker......have been informed that I have a small growth in my prostate. Test 2001 was 1.81......recent test is 4.66. Should I have a biopsy? The MD is saying yes......I have other older males who say no....I would appreciate your thoughts. Sincerely, Greg Wiechert
output: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. No, you should go for biopsy. Rising PSA level in male is having two possibilities 1. BPH that is being prostatic hypertrophy.&2. Prostatic malignancy. There is one more test PSA velocity is used to measure the exact diagnosis if you don't want to do biopsy than you can do this test. High velocity of PSA is suggestive of malignancy. Biopsy will tell you exact nature of malignancy and its possible management. So in my advice you should go for biopsy and then further management. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor.

input: Good day. My husband has had an inguinal hernia for about a year now and it is getting more and more painful and the bulge is bigger than it has ever been. He manages it very well but when it comes to sex, he produces no sperm at all. We want to have a baby soon but when he ejaculates, there s very little watery substance that comes out. He still has a strong erection and he reaches orgasm but nothing comes out. Please help
output: HelloThanks for query. Your husband has Inguinal Hernia since one year and now facing problem of not ejaculating (An ejaculation).First the problem of an ejaculation can not be due to Inguinal Hernia. This could be either due to one of the following two reasons 1) Retrograde Ejaculation 2) Blockage of the Ejaculatory duct. He needs to consult qualified Urologist for clinical examination and get following basic test done to establish cause of An ejaculation .1) Ultrasound Scanning of abdomen and Pelvis 2) Trans Rectal Ultrasound Scanning (THUS) 3) Urine examination immediately after sexual intercourse .this will rule out retrograde ejaculation.4) MRI of pelvis this will confirm dilatation of seminal vesicle and confirm blockage of ejaculatory duct. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis. Chat Doctor.

input: Hi My daughter is 8 months old and had fever, cold, cough for 3-4 days. Urine test was done and found out in the result that pus cells count is 8-10 hpf. Please suggest remedies for this. We have given another sample for culture test and is due in a couple of days time. But in general, are there any natural remedies and is there anything to worry about?
output: Pus cells 10-12/HP in urine indicate urinary tract infection which is the possible source of the fever the child is suffering from.

The main natural remedy to reduce such infection would be to Chat Doctor.  It has to backed up with proper antibiotics, and you need not worry if the course is completed.

input: Sub: Drug Treatment for Parkinson s Disease What is of the counter Chemist name for purchase of the drug ? Drug Sinemet (Levodopa/Carbidopa). Levodopa (also called L-dopa) is the most commonly prescribed and most effective drug for controlling the symptoms of Parkinson s disease, particularly bradykinesia and rigidity. Levodopa is transported to the nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine. It is then converted into dopamine for the nerve cells to use as a neurotransmitter.

However, one can always consider Deep Brain Stimulation surgery. You will need to be evaluated by a team performing DBS to be sure whether you will benefit from the surgery and when to perform the surgery. Best of luck, Chat Doctor. 

input: I am a 71 yr old female who is quite physically active; taking cardio classes about 4 days a week, including weight lifting intervals. I do not ever use higher than 3#s. I m thinking I may have pulled a muscle in my underarm area on left side. under arm quite sore to touch especially as I press into arm pit No lumps are present in arm pit or down toward and in left breast. Been treating with Ibprophen. Been going on for about a week. Seemed better but noticed today not so great. Should I see PCP at this point.

Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more in your case but better to rule out heart related chest pain first because you are old aged (71 years) and not improving in pain even after taking ibuprofen. So consult doctor and get done ECG and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Along with painkiller Chat Doctor.  1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Sit with proper back and chest support. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1-2 weeks. Stop exercise and weight lifting for 1-2 weeks. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.
