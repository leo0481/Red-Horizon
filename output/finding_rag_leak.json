Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\n\\n        <context>\\n        input: I was recently diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, after going to a neurologist his assistant informed me that it is not a pituitary tumor but it next to it by my brain...The reason I even found out about this is through an MRI I had because of vision issues that I am having (double vision) the thing is this is the third incident it seems to come and go with the first time being in 2009, the second in 2011, both with pregnancies, and now this time while I was on an appetite suppressant. What do you think\\noutput: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. If you had double vision, the tumor infiltrated cavernous sinus, and treatment depends on the kind of tumor. In that area three are the most probable lesions: Pituitary tumor, Meningioma and Chraniopharyngioma. If the size of tumor is small (below 3 cm) it could be treated by Radiosurgery, if it is greater than 3 cm it needs surgery.Don't delay treatment because there is a serious risk of blindness. Consult a Neurosurgeon. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.\\n\\ninput: I have a lump in the front of my neck above my colar bone..I noticed it three years ago or so as a small pea size, now it is the size of a 50 cent piece...I have had cancer in the left parodit gland and breast cancer in the past..so far my doctors say it is nothing...do I need to look into it more...Thank you\\noutput: Hi. With the history of cancer a lump in the area you mentioned needs at least FNAC that is Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology and may an ultrasonography. Most probably this can a normal swelling from thyroid as this has been there for a long time of 3 years and very slowly growing.\\n\\ninput: My friend had a pilodontal cyst that turned into a massive growth. He had it almost completely removed but it is deep to his tailbone and about 5in wide. His dr said today he had a rare form of squamous cancer but that is about all he was told. Can you help out. He was also told there was only about 48 cases since 2007 that have presented with this form of cancer\\noutput: Hi, Thanks for writing in. A colonial cyst is a condition which occurs in the skin over the gluteal cleft due to low intensity chronic irritation. This is treated by wide excision and I understand that your friend has got it done. The treatment of excising it till the tailbone is as recommended and his doctor gave him the right treatment. Unfortunately it has turned out as a squamous cell cancer in the biopsy report and this might require aggressive treatment. Multi modality treatment approach might be required. Since surgery is done this might be followed up by chemotherapy and radiation therapy depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer. It is being found that radiation therapy works better for squamous cell cancer of the colonial cyst. Please do not worry.\\n\\ninput: i,m a pcod patient. for last 20 years im having medicines such as  ---duoluton(L) & gluformin 500mg daily at night after dinner. now a benigntumour has grown as big as 57mmx57mm in liver section v & it is half on the liver and half hanging outside the liver towards the gallbladder. what should  i eat and what am i to do? should it be operated or regular usg to be done, in the hope that tumour may regress in time?\\noutput: Hi, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Benign tumors of the liver are uncommon in general population but are fairly common in patients who take any form of pills with a high estrogen content (oral contraceptive pills, hormonal therapy, anabolic steroids, etc.).

Although these things remain asymptomatic for a long time, they can cause pain due to increase in size. A more Chat Doctor.  In addition to this, there is also a risk of the tumor becoming cancerous. Follicular nodular hyperplasia of the liver is another possibility, but the current imaging techniques should be able to differentiate the two.

This usually causes a \\n\\ninput: Hi, I was just at the dentist and they discovered a black area on the left lower jaw area below my teeth and they called me back and said I should go get a CT scan.

Even if this is, it can be surgical managed. Wish you good health.\\n\\ninput: I have a lump in armpit since last ten years and i am not sure what it is not sure which doctor to go to?

I recently was told I have a tumur on my thyroid right size golf ball size which is getting removed in a week or so.

After my face was layed open and tumor removed then went through 29 radiation treatments, and all has been great until a few weeks ago I have started having simular symptons and I waterpick sinus cavity now at least 3-4 times a week. Any suggestions? Thanks,Robbin\\noutput: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Squamous cell cancer of the sinus cavity might become recurrent in some people. It is important that you follow up with your doctor and then get evaluated for possible recurrence. Medical literature says that squamous cell cancers have definite metastatic potential, and patients should be followed regularly after initial treatment. Overall, local recurrence rates after treatment of primary cancer ranged from about 3% to 23%, depending upon anatomic site. About 58% of local recurrences manifest within 1 year, 83% within 3 years, and 95% within 5 years. Please consult your doctor at the earliest and take treatment should there be any recurrence.
